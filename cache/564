Introduction



Bollywood is the informal term popularly used for the Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), Maharashtra, India. The name "Bollywood" is a portmanteau derived from Bombay and Hollywood (B (ombay-H) ollywood), the center of the American film industry. However, unlike Hollywood, Bollywood does not exist as a physical place. Bollywood is the largest film producer in India and one of the largest centers of film production in the world.
Bollywood is formally referred to as Hindi cinema. Dialogues are usually written in unadorned Hindi that would be understood by the largest possible audience. There has been a growing presence of Indian English in the dialogue and songs as well. Bollywood films are mostly musicals, and are expected to contain catchy music, usually a mixture of Indian and Western music, in the form of song-and-dance numbers woven into the script. Bollywood plots have tended to be melodramatic. They frequently employ formulaic ingredients such as star-crossed lovers and angry parents, love triangles, family ties, sacrifice, corrupt politicians, kidnappers, conniving villains, courtesans with hearts of gold, long-lost relatives and siblings separated by fate, dramatic reversals of fortune, and convenient coincidences. Bollywood Cinema is viewed by millions worldwide.

Aashiqui 2 is a 2013 Bollywood romantic musical drama film directed by Mohit Suri. Starring Aditya Roy Kapoor (pictured) and Shraddha Kapoor in the lead roles, it was produced by Bhushan Kumar and Mukesh Bhatt under the T-Series and Vishesh Films banners. Set in the early 2010s, Aashiqui 2 is a love story centering around the turbulent relationship between musicians Rahul and Arohi, a relationship which is affected by Rahul's issues with alcohol abuse and temperament. The film is the sequel to the 1990 musical blockbuster Aashiqui, and initially caused concern in the Indian media that the film could live up to the high standards and success of the original. Production of Aashiqui 2 began in 2011, with the principal photography taking place in Cape Town, Goa and Mumbai on a budget of ₹90 million (US$1.3 million). The film which premiered on 26 April 2013 received a positive to mixed critical reception and became a major commercial success at the box-office despite featuring newcomers, earning ₹1 billion (US$15 million) worldwide within the first four weeks. It was declared as a blockbuster by Box Office India after its three-week box office run. The soundtrack to the film became very popular after its release; the songs "Tum Hi Ho" and "Sun Raha Hai" topped the charts across various platforms in India.

R. Madhavan (born 1 June 1970) is an Indian actor, writer, film producer and television host. He has been described as one of the few actors in India who is able to achieve pan-Indian appeal, appearing in films from eight different languages. Madhavan began his acting career with television guest appearances, including a role on the Zee TV prime-time soap opera Banegi Apni Baat in 1996. After appearing in commercials and in small roles, he later gained recognition in Mani Ratnam's romantic film Alaipayuthey (2000). In the mid 2000s Madhavan also pursued a career in Hindi films, writing the dialogue for the comedy Ramji Londonwaley, before appearing in supporting roles in two big-budget productions, Rang De Basanti and Guru. He also played a critically acclaimed role in the Rajkumar Hirani's 2009 blockbuster, 3 Idiots. Madhavan has been a brand ambassador appearing in many commercials, whilst he has also played television hosts to Hindi television programmes, most notably Deal Ya No Deal in 2006. He is married to Sarita Birje and has a young son. He has supported PETA in India and has appeared in events organised for the group's promotion.
