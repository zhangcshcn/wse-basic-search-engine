The Wikipedia Sandbox


The Wikipedia Sandbox is a page designed for testing and experimenting with wiki syntax.
The Sandbox was created as a place with fewer rules and policies than other pages on Wikipedia. For example, you don't have to follow the Manual of Style or reach community consensus before making a major change. However, it must not be used for malicious purposes, and policies such as no personal attacks, civility, and copyrights (such as non-free content criteria) still apply.
If you have a username, you can create your own sandbox in your userspace. You can find your user sandbox here. (And if it doesn't exist yet, feel free to create it!) For easy access, there is a link labeled "sandbox" at the top right of every page between the "talk" and "preferences" links. You can also put {{My sandbox}} on your userpage.
If you want more sandboxes then make a page in your userspace and designate it as your sandbox. Unlike your primary sandbox, Wikipedia does not automatically keep a way to link to these, so be sure to bookmark it or otherwise have links on your userpage which go to your other sandboxes.
Specialized sandboxes

Draft:Sandbox exists for testing with the VisualEditor. It can be activated with the new editor by following this link.
Wikipedia talk:Sandbox exists for testing talk page techniques.
User:Sandbox exists for testing in the user space.
{{Template sandbox}} and {{X1}} through {{X20}} exist for testing Template-space techniques.
Category:X1 to Category:X4 exist for testing category techniques.
User talk:Sandbox for user warnings, for testing semi-automatic user warning tools.
File:Image page sandbox.png exists for testing editing on file description pages.
Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/Sandbox, for testing AutoWikiBrowser
Sandboxes in other languages can be found in a list on the lower left of the English Wikipedia Sandbox. Although using sandboxes in other languages may be useful on certain occasions, it is important to keep in mind that, unless interwiki links are used, each Sandbox can only access the links, images, and templates on the Wikipedia in which it is located.
