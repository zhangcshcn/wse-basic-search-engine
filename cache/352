Cellphone providers can then pay to put base stations (BTSs) at this shared facility. Multiple cell providers, even using different technologies, can use a single system at once.

Education[edit]

Organic World Language (Organic World Language, also known as OWL and formerly known as Organic Language Acquisition or OLA, is a method of teaching foreign languages. The six goals of the OWL methodology are for students to use the target language 100% of the time, to not be afraid of the target language environment, to take risks and break down the affective filter, to be able to infer meaning and use circumlocution to communicate, to participate and be part of a community, to cultivate intrinsic motivation and student ownership. OWL methodology accomplishes this by doing community-building activities in class, using students and their life experiences as the content and curriculum, creating a second language learning environment that mimics that of the first language, redesigning classroom seating so that students are in a circle with no desks, and consistently integrating kinesthetic movement.)

Georgia Educational Service Worker Law




I don't want to dissuade any non-COI editor from creating an article on this subject, but it should be noted that the text below is essentially a recreation of the article discussed in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Case no. 16CV300. -- RoySmith (talk) 23:37, 30 December 2016 (UTC)



Section 34-8-196 concerns the eligibility of benefits for certain service workers. It is found under Title 34, which deals with Labor and Industrial Relations; Chapter 8 handles Employment Security with Article 7 focusing on Benefits.
The provisions define "educational service workers," "educational institutions," and "educational service contractors." These definitions are the main legislative changes from previous versions (2006, 2010, and 2013). 2014 legislation reflects the changes, but the law did not go into effect until 2015. Like past versions, it sets forth interpretations for "between terms" and "reasonable assurance," and attention is paid to services in professional sports and aliens.[4]
Provisions




UI + RO Memo 2015-10


Educational Service Worker
This is anyone who works for an educational institution or educational service contractor (cafeteria worker, bus driver, librarian, cross-walk attendant, substitute, etc).
Educational Institution
This is any company in the education industry such as GSU.
Educational Service Contractor
This is any company that employs educational service workers to work for educational institutions, for example K-12 cafeteria workers and substitutes may get hired through Kelly Educational Staffing.
Between Terms
Educational service workers, professional sports workers, and aliens are "between terms" over holiday, between successive semesters, or otherwise a period of not getting paid, when they have a "reasonable assurance" of returning to work.
Reasonable Assurance
Educational service workers, professional sports workers, and aliens have "reasonable assurance" when they expect to go back to work after a period of not getting paid.
History In 2009, Georgia borrowed $721M from the federal government in order to provide benefits to nearly 500,000 unemployed.[5]
Commissioner Mark Butler considered modifications to the UI system as a way to repay the Feds.[6]
In 2012, UI rules changed[7] to restrict eligibility of benefits to educational service workers. This “action by Commissioner Mark Butler impact[ed] more than 32,000 hard- working Georgians and their families. Shockingly, his actions also have a very negative effect on the health of our state’s economy when families and local economies are denied these funds,” said Senator Emanuel Jones, Chairman of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus.[8] Community organizing resulted federal attention, and the US DOL condemned the rule as having no statutory basis.[9]
In 2013, the call to bring UI rights back[10] resulted in the repayment of $8M to 32,000 people.[11]
In 2014, GDOL paid back the federal loan ahead of schedule. “A lot has to do with the recovery,” Labor Commissioner Mark Butler said. “We’ve seen jobs grow. Plus, some of the changes we made to the unemployment system also helped.”[12]
In 2015, the legislative change went into effect defining "educational service worker," educational institution," and "educational service contractor" based on this memo from 1987.[13] Rep. Dewey McClain expressed frustration that, "the burdens were placed on the ineligible employees, rather than on the employers, who were benefiting from the status quo."[14]

The aim of Wright's methodology is in the realm of the popular life coaching trend in the helping field. Judith Sewell Wright's education in psychology and advanced degrees in counseling and education have proven substantial for her work coining the term "Soft Additions" in 1991; Wright and her subsequent theory on soft addictions in our lives. The Wright Living as an institution, however, takes the power couple on a very different path than expected from two professionals in the helping field. Wright advertises weekend trainings that cost nearly $2,000. These weekends have had stirred controversy over their strict guidelines and push on students to stay longer than they feel comfortable; [278]
