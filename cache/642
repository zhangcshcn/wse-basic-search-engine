The Rhode Island Portal





Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (more commonly referred to as Rhode Island ( /roʊd ˈaɪlɨnd/ (help·info))) is a state in the New England region of the United States and is the smallest U.S. state by area. Rhode Island borders Connecticut to the west and Massachusetts to the north and east; it also shares a water border with New York's Long Island to the southwest. Despite being called Rhode Island in common usage, most of the state is on the continental mainland. Rhode Island was the colonial-era name for what is now commonly known as Aquidneck Island,[1] the largest of several islands in Narragansett Bay which comprises the city of Newport and the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth.
Rhode Island was the first of the thirteen original colonies to declare independence from British rule and the last to ratify the United States Constitution. The state's official nickname is "The Ocean State," a reference to the fact that nearly one tenth of Rhode Island's inland area is covered by salt water. In addition, no area of the state is more than a thirty-minute drive from the water's edge (under normal traffic conditions). Rhode Island is unofficially referred to as Little Rhody.

Rhode Island has the second lowest number of counties of any U.S. state; only Delaware has fewer, with three counties. Rhode Island does not have any local government at the county level; instead, local government is provided by the eight cities and thirty-one towns. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations was established in the 17th century and was the first of the thirteen original American colonies to declare independence from British rule in 1776, signaling the start of the American Revolution. The counties were all established before the Declaration of Independence. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties. Rhode Island's code is 44, which would be written as 44XXX when combined with any county code.
