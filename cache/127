Scope and goals


This WikiProject aims to organise, expand and improve all Wikipedia's articles on areas or subjects relating to computers, computing, and information technology. We have a very broad scope, so we hope to collaborate and communicate with other Wikiprojects that overlap our domain.
Our scope includes:
1. History of computing
2. Computer science and computer programming
3. Networking and the Internet
4. Server technology
5. Databases
6. Hardware
7. Computer security
8. Software
9. Operating systems
10. Network programming
11. Software developer
Our goal is to produce detailed, well written and NPOV articles on all topics related to computers.

Departments


Assessment
The assessment department focuses on assessing the quality of Wikipedia's computing articles. While much of the work is done in conjunction with the WP:1.0 program, the article ratings are also used within the project itself to aid in recognizing excellent contributions and identifying topics in need of further work.
The ratings are done in a distributed fashion through parameters in the {{WikiProject Computing}} project banner; this causes the articles to be placed in a set of categories that serves as the basis for an automatically generated worklist.
Collaboration
The project's Collaboration department seeks to identify particular articles that would benefit from a significant collaborative effort. A single article is selected as the focus, and the project attempts to improve it, potentially to featured article standards. Users can also nominate articles for future collaboration.
Outreach
The outreach department acts as the project's central point of coordination for recruiting new members and maintaining the interest of current participants. Its primary activity is the production of monthly project newsletters. A number of additional programs are either underway or being planned.
Peer review
The peer review department conducts peer reviews of articles on request; this helps to obtain ideas for further improvement by having contributors who may not have previously worked on particular articles examine them. Project members are invited to submit articles to the department in lieu of using the generic peer review process.
