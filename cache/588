THE TENNIS PORTAL


Tennis is a sport played between either two players (singles) or two teams of two players each (doubles). Players use a stringed racquet to strike a ball, a hollow rubber sphere covered in felt, over a net into the opponent's court. Tennis used to be called lawn tennis to distinguish it from its predecessor real tennis (also known as royal tennis, court tennis or jeu de paume), a form of the game played indoors on a different kind of a court. Originating in England in the late 19th century, the game spread first throughout the English-speaking world, particularly among the upper classes. Tennis is played in the Summer Olympic Games and at all levels of society, by individuals of all ages many countries around the world. Its rules have remained largely unchanged since the 1890s. Along with its millions of players, tennis claims millions of people who follow the sport as spectators, being particularly interested in the four Grand Slam tournaments.

Selected article



Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are professional tennis players engaged in a storied rivalry, which many consider the greatest in the game's history. Their first match was in 2004
Federer and Nadal are the only pair of men to have finished six consecutive calendar years as the top two ranked players on the ATP Tour, from 2005–2010. Federer was ranked No. 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004. Nadal, who is four years and ten months younger, ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks before surpassing Federer in August 2008. Federer regained the No. 1 ranking in June 2009, due in part to Nadal's injury hiatus, which also caused Nadal to briefly fall to No. 3. Nadal returned to No. 2 in September but dropped two spots in February 2010, and regained the World No. 2 after winning the Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open in May 2010 (against Federer in the final). After winning the 2010 French Open, Nadal regained the No. 1 position again.
Nadal leads their overall head-to-head series 23–10. Because tournament seedings are based on rankings, 20 of their matches have been in tournament finals, including an all-time record 7 Grand Slam finals. From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final, and then they met in the 2009 Australian Open final. Nadal won five of the seven, losing the first two Wimbledons. Three of these matches lasted five sets (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 Australian Open), and the 2008 Wimbledon final—which Nadal won—has been lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts. They have also played in a record 9 Masters Series finals, including their lone five hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set tiebreak.

Selected biography



Pete Sampras (born 12 August 1971), is a former World No. 1 American tennis player. During his 15-year career, he won a record 14 Grand Slam men's singles titles in 52 appearances. Sampras finished as World No. 1 on the ATP rankings for six consecutive years, a record for the open era and tied for third all-time.
Sampras won the singles title at Wimbledon seven times, a record shared with William Renshaw and Roger Federer. He also won five singles titles at the US Open, an open era record shared with Jimmy Connors. Bud Collins has named Sampras as one of the top five men's tennis players of all-time, and TENNIS Magazine has named him the greatest player from 1965 through 2005. On July 17, 2007, Sampras was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

Selected quote




“
Some folks call tennis a rich people’s sport or a white person’s game. I guess I started too early because I just thought it was something fun to do. Later, I discovered there was a lot of work to being good in tennis. You’ve got to make a lot of sacrifices and spend a lot of time if you really want to achieve with this sport, or in any sport, or in anything truly worthwhile.
”


— Arthur Ashe
