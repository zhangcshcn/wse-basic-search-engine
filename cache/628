Location of Minnesota in the United States






The flag of Minnesota, adopted in 1893


Minnesota ( pronounced ˌmɪnɨˈsoʊtə (help·info)) is a state located in the Midwestern region of the United States. The 12th-largest state by area in the U.S., and the 21st most populous, with approximately five million residents. Minnesota was carved out of the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory and admitted to the Union as the 32nd state on May 11, 1858. The state is known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes, and those lakes and the other waters for which the state is named, together with the national forests and parks, offer residents and tourists a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities.
Approximately 60% of Minnesota's residents live in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area known as the Twin Cities, the center of transportation, business, and industry, and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state, often referred to as "Greater Minnesota" or "Outstate Minnesota", consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; eastern deciduous forests, also heavily farmed and settled; and the less populated northern boreal forest.

Hopkins, Minnesota



Hopkins is a suburban community located west of Minneapolis in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. The city is about four square miles in size and is surrounded by the larger, west suburban communities of Minnetonka, St. Louis Park, and Edina. Hopkins is about 98% developed with little remaining vacant land. U.S. Highway 169 and Minnesota Highway 7 are two of the main arterial routes in the city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 4.1 square miles (10.6 km²), all land. With this in mind, it should be noted that there are several small ponds on the western side, and some creeks to the north and south. One of these creeks includes Minnehaha Creek. (Full article)

February in the history of Minnesota






Bandshell at Lake Harriet, 2006


The first park in Minneapolis was land donated to the city in 1857, but it took about 25 years for the community to take a major interest in its parks. The Minneapolis Board of Trade and other civic leaders pressed the Minnesota Legislature for assistance. On February 27, 1883, the Legislature authorized the city to form a park district and to levy taxes. The initial vision was to create a number of boulevards, based on the design concepts of Frederick Law Olmsted, that would connect parks. Civic leaders also hoped to stimulate economic development and increase land values. Landscape architect Horace Cleveland was hired to create a system of parks named the "Grand Rounds".
