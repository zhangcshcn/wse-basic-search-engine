**Extended confirmed prot.

* When an Administrator or Pending Changes Reviewer edits an article that has pending changes awaiting review, they are prompted to review the pending changes before saving their edit.
** This row assumes that a Pending changes reviewer is also Extended confirmed. (A Pending changes reviewer needs separate Extended confirmed rights to edit through Extended confirmed protection; in practice nearly all Pending changes reviewers will have that additional right.)
