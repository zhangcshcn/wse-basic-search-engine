Before making a request here, you should be aware that your account only needs to exist for four days and make ten edits and it will be automatically confirmed. Since the bar for automatic confirmation is deliberately quite low, the vast majority of requests here are denied. Unless you are requesting confirmation for a legitimate alternate account your request will almost certainly be denied. Alternatives are presented below:

Are you here to solely upload an image? Please make a request at Files for upload for non-free images or use the same username and password you have here to upload free images at Wikimedia Commons.
Are you here because you want to edit a page, but the page is protected from editing? With no track record for your account there is no basis for knowing if we should confirm you early. 95% of Wikipedia articles are not protected, so you can dive right into those or use {{edit protected}} to request edits on the article's talk page
Are you here because you want to change the name of an article? Please use the Requested moves process for that.

Reason for requesting confirmed rights

Hi, I was trying to edit a grammatical error on the page for Milo Yiannopoulis but it is semi-protected. The sentence reads: "Yiannopoulos has been called a spokesperson for the alt-right, although he denies this even if he recognises that he may share some of their political views"; but should in fact read: "...he may share some of its political views" because the alt-right is a collective noun, which should take a singular pronoun.

 Not done - Hi, and thank you for creating an account to edit Wikipedia. Although I fully understand your desire to dive right in, many of our articles are semi-protected because they are controversial, prone to vandalism, or other reasons. As a new editor with few edits, it might be wise to discuss your edits on the article talkpage in order to gain consensus for your edits, and then use {{Edit semi-protected}} to request the edit be performed. I only recommend this until you're used to the challenges of reliable sources, the biographies of living persons policy, and other similar policies. The good news is that fewer than 5% of Wikipedia articles are protected; this means that 95% of the articles can use your help right now! — Coffee // have a cup // beans // 06:54, 11 February 2017 (UTC)

On List of fictional cats in Animation

You forgot a character named Jiji the Black Cat from Kiki's Delivery Service. He's a Talking Black Cat that Kiki the young witch owns. A 1989 Studio Ghibli Movie was directed by Hayao Miyazaki. So don't forget about jiji. Any Questions? Send me a notification. Marin100123 (talk) 03:10, 11 February 2017 (UTC)
