How to request an article



First, check that the article you're looking for doesn't already exist:

Search Wikipedia (or use a search engine) for existing articles. If an article exists, but not at the title you expected, you can create a redirect.
Check your spelling.
Articles generally use the most common name for the subject. This may not be the official name, scientific name, or another name you have in mind.

Next, be sure the article is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia. Articles should be about topics that have received significant coverage in independent, reliable sources. We have a fairly precise definition of what is considered a "reliable source", as well as detailed inclusion guidelines.
If that seems OK, find the appropriate general topic area below, choose the best sub-topic that fits your subject, and use that link to go to its page. Add your request there by clicking "edit" at the appropriate heading. Give a brief description, with links if possible, for the proposed topic, to aid others in understanding your request.





I want to write an article myself



If you have written an article, you can submit it for creation. Be aware that there are guidelines about what is an acceptable subject for an article, as mentioned above.





For editors



Please help by fulfilling these requests!

Help maintain the list by moving misplaced or unsorted requests to the appropriate section.
Many requests can be fulfilled by creating a redirect from the requested title.
Fulfilled requests should be removed from the list. Remember to categorize newly created articles, and tag them as stubs if they are short.

Wikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles
Many WikiProjects and notice boards have requests for new articles pertaining to a specific topic.
Wikipedia:Drawing board - a noticeboard for discussing new article ideas. (Inactive)
Wikipedia:WikiProject Red Link Recovery
Wikipedia:Article Feedback Tool
Wikipedia:Articles for creation - allows unregistered and new users to create new articles with the assistance of experienced Wikipedians.
Wikipedia:Requests for expansion/Archive, Category:Articles to be expanded and Category:Stubs lists very short preliminary articles that have not yet been developed.
Category:Redirects with possibilities lists many redirects with good potential to become future articles.
Portal:Current events - displays newsworthy topics— even brief entries for those are very helpful. They have the advantage of already having a reference webpage, and would have been verified in most cases by the news media. (see also Wikinews)
