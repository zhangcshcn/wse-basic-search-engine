Uses Lua:


Module:Protection banner





This template is used to indicate a page is protected under extended confirmed protection, restricting editing to users in the extended confirmed user group.
Usage

Use {{pp-30-500}} for the normal template
Use {{pp-30-500|small=yes}} for just an icon at the top

Note adding this form of protection is only for pages that qualify under the extended confirmed section of the protection policy. Simply placing this template on a page will not make it protected.
Instructions

Change the protection level of the article to "Allow only extended confirmed users". For ArbCom-enforced topics, the duration should be indefinite. The consensus for community use recommends temporary usage only.
Add {{pp-30-500|small=yes}} to the article.
Remove any instances of {{pp}} templates from the page, as the blue padlock icon generated by this template will suffice.
Add {{ds/30-500-editnotice}} or other appropriate template to the page notice of the article (found at Template:Editnotices/Page/PAGENAME), passing the template one of the valid arbitration decision codes. The code will modify the language accordingly. For instance, for Nair, {{ds/30-500-editnotice|ipa}} is added to Template:Editnotices/Page/Nair as it is part of the India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan arbitration decision.

A full-size protection banner, as offered by other protection templates, is not currently supported. Other parameters such as expiry do not apply to this type of protection.

This template will categorize into Category:Wikipedia pages under 30-500 editing restriction.
