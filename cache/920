Template:Permanently protected is permanently protected from editing because it is a heavily used and/or highly visible template. Substantial changes should be proposed here first. If the proposal is uncontroversial or has been discussed and is supported by consensus, editors may use {{edit protected}} to notify an administrator to make the requested edit.
Any contributor may edit the template's documentation to add usage notes or categories.
