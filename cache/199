Chemical engineering is the application of science, in particular chemistry, fluid physics, and biology, along with mathematics and economics to the human endeavor of converting raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms. Its practitioners are called chemical engineers. Chemical engineering is a broad field that encompasses many subfields, including biotechnology, nanotechnology, mineral processing, ceramics, fluid dynamics, environmental science, materials science and thermodynamics.

The main article for this category is Chemical engineering.





Pages in this category should be moved to subcategories where applicable.
This category may require frequent maintenance to avoid becoming too large. It should directly contain very few, if any, pages and should mainly contain subcategories.
