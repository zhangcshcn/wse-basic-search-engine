There's always work of some sort to be done; if you can't find any particular projects here to interest you, peruse pages within the Metalworking category to look for improvements you can make, or check out the Cleanup listing for articles that need improvement.
Feel free to add any tasks here that you think deserve the attention of the whole project; please sign using ~~~~ and make sure to strikethrough or remove items as they are completed.
Keep in mind that if a machine exists for only one purpose or process, it's usually better to devote a section of the article for the process to the machine, rather than give the machine a separate article. If a complete, sourced article can be written about the machine, then by all means do so; this usually is not the case.
Vital articles[edit]
These are articles vital to the subject of metalworking; it would bolster the quality of Metalworking on Wikipedia significantly to bring them up to Featured article status.

Machining

References and sources[edit]
If you take a look at the categorical cleanup listing, you'll see that the two biggest categories by a huge margin are "Articles needing additional references" and "Articles with unsourced statements." I feel like most of the content across these articles is fairly reliable, so adding references and verifying shouldn't be a particularly arduous task. If anyone has access to technical manuals or other kinds of reliable sources, it would be a huge benefit to the project, disproportionate to the effort required. I've begun working on this, I've got access to one of the best libraries in the southeastern US, but I lack the appropriate expertise to efficiently find the right texts. --Kierkkadon talk/contribs 04:57, 23 January 2013 (UTC)

I want to make it clear that I'm not impugning the value of unsourced contributions; on the contrary, I think very highly of much of the content covered by this project, unsourced or not. I'm not a deletionist, neither do I think that content should just come out of left field; but I do know that in metalworking in particular a lot of important information is just held as expert knowledge that's difficult to attach to a source. Add to that the tendency for technical manuals to be really dense and ... well, technical, and it's obvious why metalworking has so much content with so little referencing. This may not be true of all subjects, but metalworking is an area where I think we are better off having experts add their knowledge and then others follow along later verifying and referencing. For what it's worth. --Kierkkadon talk/contribs 05:13, 31 January 2013 (UTC)




I agree. And I feel that metalworking isn't alone regarding this theme—it holds true across various content areas in Wikipedia. It holds most strongly in industrial, commercial, and applied science areas, even more than in areas of pure science, academe, pop culture, and personal hobbies. So I'm glad to be a part of building areas like metalworking. It takes time, but it's a worthwhile pursuit... — ¾-10 01:30, 1 February 2013 (UTC)



Request for reassessment[edit]
I just recently did a lot of rewrites and content-adding to Fixture (tool). It was listed as stub-class, now I think it deserves a better qualification but I don't feel comfortable basically grading myself on my own work. --Kierkkadon talk/contribs 23:02, 26 January 2013 (UTC)

I've basically done exactly the same thing to Centerless grinding. I'd love for somebody to reassess it; I don't quite think it qualifies as Start class anymore. --Kierkkadon talk/contribs 17:33, 31 January 2013 (UTC)

Requested articles[edit]
See also: List of requested machine tool builder articles

The following three either need to be outline-style pages, containing lists of pages that fall within their purvue, or dedicated articles themselves; these, from what I understand, are the three major categories into which all modern metalworking processes fall. They may exist as different names, but I think it would greatly improve the cohesion of Metalworking as a subject on Wikipedia if they were to be standardized. —Kierkkadon talk/contribs 16:33, 6 February 2013 (UTC)

Forming (metalworking)

Done, but it still needs a fair amount of expansion and harmonization with the rest of Metalworking. —Kierkkadon talk/contribs 18:08, 6 February 2013 (UTC)


Cutting (metalworking)

Instead of starting an article I expanded this one - cutting, this is my first non-trivial edit, feedback appreciated. Tealeafe 02 August 2014

Also done, but the merge has been disputed. Input would be quite welcome, as it doesn't look like this dispute is going anywhere. Talk:Industrial etching#Merge with Chemical milling —Kierkkadon talk/contribs 19:26, 13 February 2013 (UTC)

Tooling (currently a redirect) Wizard191 (talk) 21:27, 7 January 2010 (UTC)

I thought tooling was industry jargon for tool supply and management, which Tool management covers. What would a separate Tooling article cover? --Kierkkadon talk/contribs 14:10, 30 January 2013 (UTC)

The term "tooling" traditionally to machinists, and today to machinists, has been a mass noun referring en masse to a certain range of kinds of tools—all of the cutting tools, tool holders, machine tool accessories, and tool and die–type equipment, such as fixtures and dies, used along with a machine tool itself to accomplish making a part. The machine tool itself is mentally separate, and the hand tools in one's toolbox, like a screwdriver, are not included either—this notion of which tools are not mentally classed as "tooling" is the part that non-machinists might find non-intuitive. The term "tool management" was not commonly used decades ago, but the concept would have been readily recognized—keeping track of tooling, maintaining/replacing, in short, managing it. Back then such work was done with files in cabinets and index cards in card catalog–type files (and in people's heads, although that's not a great method), and so forth—today it's done with software, but the concepts/goals are the same. I could see having a short separate article for tooling, simply for the reason of helping laypeople to understand what the word connotes, rather than for the sake of having a separate article, in itself. But I haven't thought it out extensively. I will give it some thought ...

It may not necessitate its own article, though there is enough science behind it to make one, Shrink Fitting is a process used on all spin tooling. It is definitely worth mentioning in a Tooling article. Will Prater

An IP editor recently changed the Tooling page from a redirect to an in-text request for deletion, and he also went around to a couple of other articles removing See also links to Tool management [1] [2]. I left a message on his talk page asking him about it, but I've never actually seen an IP editor respond. —Kierkkadon talk/contribs 20:52, 12 February 2013 (UTC)

Direct chill casting Wizard191 (talk) 17:31, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
Laser machining (currently a redirect) - Here's a good ref: [3]. Wizard191 (talk) 21:58, 30 April 2010 (UTC)

Why does this need to be its own article? What would Laser machining cover that Laser cutting doesn't? --Kierkkadon talk/contribs 19:26, 28 January 2013 (UTC)


Autogrinder Wizard191 (talk) 13:32, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

Gang milling needs to be merged into this after its creation. Wizard191 (talk) 22:41, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

And done. --Kierkkadon talk/contribs 01:36, 30 January 2013 (UTC)

Kierkkadon
I'm trying to restart this whole WikiProject. I do whatever work I can on articles, especially adding references to metallurgical manuals and materials textbooks. I rewrote this Project page, trying to give it a cleaner look while simultaneously updating the to-do lists and resources. --Kierkkadon talk/contribs 18:44, 22 January 2013 (UTC)


¾-10
Article expansion. Referencing improvement. Watchlisting to revert vandalism. Making chips. Sharing knowledge. Content areas that I have a soft spot for include industrial history, machine tools and machine tool builders, reading the memoirs of "practical men", as they used to put it years ago (as well as practical women). But I also end up editing in other areas too ... — ¾-10 00:14, 23 January 2013 (UTC)
