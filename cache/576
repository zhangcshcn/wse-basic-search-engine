Welcome to Wikipedia's portal for music. Music consists of sound heard over time. It is predominantly used to evoke emotion or thought in the listener. Music is often described as an art form that involves organized sounds and silence. It is considered by some cultures to be a language in and of itself. Music is also used as an accompaniment to dance, as a part of some religious rituals and a means to communicate with spirits. Within the arts, music can be classified as a performing art, a fine art, and an auditory art form though the definitions of music vary according to culture and social context.

Frederick Theodore Albert Delius, CH was an English composer. He was sent to Florida in the United States in 1884 to manage an orange plantation; influenced by African-American music, he began composing. After a brief period of formal musical study in Germany beginning in 1886, he embarked on a full-time career as a composer in Paris and then in nearby Grez-sur-Loing, where he and his wife Jelka lived (except during the First World War) for the rest of their lives.
Delius's first successes came in Germany. In Delius's native Britain, it was 1907 before his music made regular appearances in concert programmes, after Thomas Beecham took it up. Beecham conducted the full premiere of A Mass of Life in London in 1909 and mounted a six-day Delius festival in London in 1929, as well as making gramophone recordings of many of Delius's works. After 1918 Delius became paralysed and blind, but completed some late compositions between 1928 and 1932 with the aid of an amanuensis, Eric Fenby.
