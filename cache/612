Gibraltar (pronounced /dʒɨˈbrɔːltər/) is a British overseas territory located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula at the entrance of the Mediterranean, overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar. The territory itself is a peninsula of 6.843 square kilometres (2.642 sq mi) whose isthmus connects to the north with Spain. The Rock of Gibraltar is the major landmark of the area and gives its name to the densely populated town, home to almost 30,000 Gibraltarians.
Gibraltar was captured by a joint Anglo-Dutch force in 1704 during the War of Spanish Succession and subsequently ceded to Britain by Spain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations as Spain asserts a claim to the territory and seeks its return. Gibraltarians resoundingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in referendums held in 1967 and 2002.
GibraltarpediA is an important Wikipedia project that intends to create the "World's First Wikipedia City". The project is being run in partnership with the Government of Gibraltar, The Wikimedia Foundation, the Wikipedia community and the people of Gibraltar. The project is bridging Europe and Africa.

During World War II, Gibraltar served a vital role in the Mediterranean Theatre, controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the Mediterranean Sea from the west.
Inside the Rock of Gibraltar itself, miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone. Masses of rock were blasted out to build an "underground city". In huge man-made caverns, barracks, offices, and a fully equipped hospital were constructed, complete with an operating theatre and x-ray equipment.
Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942, was coordinated from the "Rock". General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was given command of the operation, set up his headquarters in Gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation. (more...)
