Anne Frank is referred to as "Aids" in the first line of her bio. It should be corrected and made "Anne."

Yom Kippur War, first paragraph states "a joint surprise attack".  The attack was not a surprise, even the article backs it up.  

Egyptians made a statement saying they would fight for land, Israeli intelligence was at fault and relied too heavily on Arab aggression model known as "the Concept" or Konseptzia. Should be changed to attack.

Please make this request at talk:Yom Kippur War. Monty845 03:38, 25 May 2012 (UTC)

 Not done: This page is only for proposing changes to the Enforcement policy list, I suspect you are probably in the wrong place.
If you want to suggest a change, please request this in the form "Please replace XXX with YYY" or "Please add ZZZ between PPP and QQQ".
Given the nature of this page, any such changes will also require consensus - Arjayay (talk) 09:33, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
