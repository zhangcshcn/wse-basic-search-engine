Featured topics in Wikipedia

A featured topic is a collection of inter-related articles that are of a good quality (though not necessarily featured articles). A featured topic represents Wikipedia's best work by thoroughly covering all parts of that topic through several high-quality articles that share a similar structure and are well-linked with each other. To become featured, a topic must meet a set of criteria.
Featured topics are nominated and discussed at the Wikipedia:Featured topic candidates page, where they are either accepted or rejected. Additions to existing featured topics are also discussed there. Do not add an article directly to a featured topic without nominating it first.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] There are currently 147 featured topics that encompass 1136 unique articles. There are 15 articles in two featured topics, 36 articles in a featured topic and a good topic, 1 article in two featured topics and a good topic, and 1 article in a featured topic and two good topics. There are 48 topics in which every article is featured if possible.

In the topic boxes below:

 indicates that the article is a featured article or featured list.
 indicates that the article is a good article.
 indicates that the article is an audited article of limited subject matter or inherent instability.
 indicates that every article in the topic is featured if possible.
 indicates that the article has lost its good or featured article status, or was previously an audited article of limited subject matter, but no longer is (only in the case of a topic under grace period).
