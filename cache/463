Early life and discovery[edit]
Pedersen was born on November 19, 1981 in Skjern, Denmark. She worked as a waitress before being discovered on her way to Norway by train.[4][5] Another model scouted her, and by the time the train arrived at Central Station, the head of 2pm Model Management wanted to see her. At first, she thought the whole thing was a joke, and all of it was fake, so she politely refused, although after she left Norway, she traveled to Copenhagen to meet with the agency to just say hello.[4]
Career[edit]
She ended up signing with 2pm and worked locally before heading to New York City for the first time. Before she left New York for Milan's fashion shows, Mario Testino spoke with her. During her castings at Milan, designers would casually say, "Oh, that's the girl Mario was talking about."
Her debut as the opener for the fall 2002 Prada was actually a surprise. She did not know she would open the show until a few minutes before it started.[4] Walking for other designers like Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, and Calvin Klein that season made her one of the most in-demand girls for seasons to come. In 2003, she was featured in an infamous Gucci advertisement, where it showed male model Adam Senn in the act of pulling her underwear down, and it revealed her pubic hair had a "G" shaved into it.[5] The ad was banned in various countries, because of the radical advertising[6]
In 2006, she became the face of the Danish jewellery and accessories brand Pilgrim.
Her campaigns and magazines have also gained her some ground. She has booked campaigns for Gucci, Levi's, Tiffany, Hugo Boss, Rolex, Carolina Herrera, Chanel, and DKNY. She is the current face of Maxmara's fragrance and DKNY's fragrance, "Be Delicious".[7] She has also graced the pages of Vogue and Allure.[2]
After leaving the runway for a few seasons, Louise walked for Givenchy and Diesel Black Gold Fall 2009/2010
Personal life[edit]
Pedersen has made friends with models Anouck Lepere, May Anderson, Diana Dondoe and Adam Senn. She likes to paint, especially in the spirit of Gustav Klimpt.[4] She gave birth to her daughter, Maya, in 2007 and divorced Arthur Meehan (farther of Maya) in 2010.
