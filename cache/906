Uses Lua:


Module:Protection banner





Usage

This template is used for pages that are pending changes level 2 protected.


This template categorizes articles into Category:Wikipedia pending changes protected pages (level 2).


This template will be visible on pages that are not protected. Adding this template to an article does not protect it. Protection can only be applied by administrators, and can be requested at Wikipedia:Requests for page protection.


This template uses a parser function. To give greater detail to the template, you may specify: the protection expiry, and a specific reason for protection.


{{Pp-pc2|expiry=date|reason=due to a reason}}




Notes


If protection is set without an expiry date (indefinitely) do not include the |expiry= parameter. Do not use |expiry=indef (or indefinitely) as this will break the template.
The reason parameter will produce:




"All edits by users who are not reviewers or administrators are subject to review reason." if the expiry parameter is omitted or if |indef=yes is included.
"All edits by users who are not reviewers or administrators are subject to review until January 1, 2014 reason." if the expiry parameter is set (in this case to January 1, 2014).
Note: The preceding space and full stop are automatically included.
