In rail transport, a train is a vehicle or (more frequently) a string of vehicles capable of being moved along a continuous line of rails or other guideway for the purpose of conveying freight or passengers between points on a predetermined route. The train may be hauled or propelled by one or more vehicles designed exclusively for that purpose (locomotives) or may be driven by a number of motors incorporated in all or several of the vehicles (multiple units).
As of 2006[update], there are approximately 1,370,782 kilometres (851,764 mi) of railway track in use worldwide.

The Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR) is a 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge heritage railroad and attraction in the Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom theme park in Bay Lake, Florida, in the United States. Its route is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) in length and encircles the vast majority of the park, with stations in the Main Street, U.S.A., Frontierland, and Fantasyland sections. The rail line, which was built by Retlaw Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering), is operated with four historic steam locomotives originally built by Baldwin Locomotive Works. Each of the four locomotives pulls a set of five passenger cars with seating capacity for 75 passengers per car, for a total of 375 passengers per train. The Walt Disney World Railroad opened to the public for the first time on October 1, 1971, the same day that the Magic Kingdom park first opened. Since then the WDWRR has become one of the world's most popular steam-powered railroads, with 3.7 million passengers served each year.

...that British Railways Standard Class 7 number 70013 Oliver Cromwell was selected to operate the last steam passenger train prior to the abolition of steam traction on British Railways lines?
...that for the construction of Great Western Railway's Box Tunnel in Western England in 1838, candles provided the only lighting and were consumed at the rate of one tonne per week, equalled by the weekly consumption of explosives?
...that the relocated and restored Bowie Railroad Buildings in Bowie, Maryland, which are now the Bowie Railroad Museum, served as the city's station from 1913 until 1989?
...that unlike many trolley poles used for current collection on trams, the bow collector developed by Siemens in the late 19th century did not normally have a revolving base but was rather fixed centrally to the tramcar roof?

2017 in rail transport





February 9, 2016 – Two Meridian-branded passenger trains collide in a head-on collision at Bad Aibling in southeastern Germany. In total 11 people die and 150 others are injured, including 20 seriously. Early reports suggested that the accident may have been the fault of the dispatcher allowing two opposing trains on a single-track section of line, but police investigating the incident have dismissed theory this as "pure speculation." (Bavaria Police) (Bavaria Police) (Tages Spiegel) (Tegernseer Stimme) (RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland) (BBC)






January 22, 2016 – In anticipation of heavy snowfall and preparation for the effects of winter storm Jonas, Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA) shuts down all services for the weekend. Metrorail services, which constitute the second largest rapid transit system in the United States, are suspended as of 11:00 pm and will remain closed until Monday morning. Action to shut down the system was previously taken in October 2012 during hurricane Sandy. Trains will be stored in the system's subway tunnels to shelter them from the storm. (WMATA) (WMATA) (Washington Post) (The Hill)






December 30, 2015 – Construction begins on the Ningbo–Fenghua Intercity Railway in China. The 21.8-kilometre long (13.5 mi) line, expected to open in 2020, will be a suburban metro line connecting Gaotang Bridge Station to Jinhai Road Station. (CNNB)






December 11, 2015 – The first phase of the Nanning–Kunming High-Speed Railway, connecting Nanning to Baise, opens. This first section of double track mainline was built to allow CRH2A trains to travel up to 250 kilometres per hour (160 mph). The newly constructed line, which will eventually connect to Kunming, will be Yunnan Province's first high-speed transport corridor to the sea. (GXNews)






November 17, 2015 – The Jaffar Express passenger train traveling from Quetta to Rawalpindi, Pakistan, derails killing 20 and injuring almost a hundred others. The train's driver and assistant driver were among the fatalities. Early reports indicate that the train's brakes had failed; Pakistan Railways is investigating the accident.

November 14, 2015 – A test TGV train traveling eastbound on the southern track of the LGV Est high-speed rail line derails as it enters a curve at 265 km/h (165 mph) in Eckwersheim. The accident killed eleven crew and injured the remaining 42 persons aboard, which included 4 children who were not authorized by SNCF to be on the train. According to investigators, late braking, which led to the train entering the curve at excessive speed, was the immediate cause of the accident. (BBC) (DNA) (SNCF)
