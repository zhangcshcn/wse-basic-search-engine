The Nevada Portal





Nevada ( /nəˈvæːdə/ (help·info)) is a state located in the western region of the United States. At 110,567 sq mi (286,367 km2), Nevada is the seventh-largest state, and includes parts of the Mojave Desert in the south and Great Basin in the north. Nevada is the "Silver State" due to rich deposits of silver discovered and mined there. In 1864, Nevada became the 36th state to enter the union, and the phrase "Battle Born" on the state flag reflects the state's entry on the Union side during the American Civil War. Its first historical settlement was Mormon Station.
Today, approximately 86% of the state's land is owned by the U.S federal government under various jurisdictions both civilian and military. In 2008 about 2.6 million people resided in Nevada, over 85% in the metropolitan areas of Las Vegas (the largest city) and Reno. The state capital is Carson City. The state is noted for its easy marriage and divorce proceedings, entertainment, legal gambling and, in 8 out of its 16 counties, legal brothels. (more...)

Vengeance (2005) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on June 26, 2005 at the Thomas & Mack Center in Paradise, Nevada. It was the fifth annual Vengeance event. Professional wrestling is a type of sports entertainment in which theatrical events are combined with a competitive sport. The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before, during, and after the event were planned by WWE's script writers. The event starred wrestlers from the Raw brand: storyline expansions of the promotion where employees are assigned to wrestling brands under the WWE banner. The main event was a Hell in a Cell match for the World Heavyweight Championship between Batista and Triple H, which Batista won by pinfall after executing a Batista Bomb. One of the predominant matches on the card was John Cena versus Chris Jericho versus Christian in a Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship. Cena won the match and retained the title after pinning Christian. Another primary match on the undercard was Kurt Angle versus Shawn Michaels in a rematch of their bout at WrestleMania 21.

Selected quote





Each city is an archetype rather than a prototype, an exaggerated example from which to derive lessons for the typical. Each city vividly superimposes elements of a supranational scale on the local fabric: churches in the religious capital, casinos in the entertainment capital. These cause violent juxtapositions of use and scale in both cities. Rome’s churches, off streets and piazzas, are open to the public; the pilgrim, religious or architectural, can walk from church to church. The gambler or architect in Las Vegas can similarly take in a variety of casinos along the Strip. The casinos and lobbies of Las Vegas are ornamental and monumental and open to the promenading public.
— Robert Venturi
