Flag of Indiana

Indiana is the 19th U.S. state and is located in the Midwest region of the United States of America. With over six million residents, it is ranked 15th in population and 17th in population density. It is 38th in land area. Indiana is bounded on the north by Lake Michigan and the state of Michigan; on the east by Ohio; on the south by Kentucky, with which it shares the Ohio River as a border; and on the west by Illinois. Indiana is one of the Great Lakes states. As of 2006, Indiana has an estimated population of 6,313,520, which is an increase of 47,501, or 0.8%, from the prior year and an increase of 233,003, or 3.8%, since the year 2000. The total gross state product in 2005 was US$214 billion in 2000 chained dollars. Indiana's per capita income, as of 2005, was US$31,150. The Calumet region of northwest Indiana is the largest steel producing area in the U.S.
Indiana is a diverse state with a few large urban areas and a number of smaller industrial cities. It is best known for the Indianapolis 500 American automobile race, held annually over the Memorial Day weekend, and a strong basketball tradition, often called Hoosier Hysteria. Residents of Indiana are called Hoosiers. The state's name means "Land of the Indians" and Angel Mounds State Historic Site, one of the best preserved prehistoric Native American sites in the United States, can be found in southern Indiana.

The Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, often shortened to Indianapolis 500 or Indy 500, is an American automobile race, held annually over the Memorial Day weekend at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. The event, billed as "The Greatest Spectacle in Racing", is one of the oldest and richest motorsport events in existence, having the largest attendance and one of the largest radio and television audiences of any single-day sporting event worldwide. While the official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management, news media estimate attendance in excess of 270,000.
The event lends its name to the "IndyCar" class of formula, or open-wheel, race cars that have competed in it. It has been broadcast live over radio on the IMS Radio Network since 1952, televised live in 1949 and 1950 on local station WFBM-TV (now WRTV), and not again until ABC Sports was permitted to broadcast the race via tape delay from 1965 to 1985, and then with live flag-to-flag coverage beginning in 1986. On Sunday May 27, 2007, the race celebrated its 91st running and 62nd consecutive year of uninterrupted occurrence. It also marked the first year the TV broadcast was in HDTV. The winner for the 2007 Indianapolis 500 was Dario Franchitti.

Selected biography


Steve McQueen (March 24, 1930 – November 7, 1980) was an American movie actor, nicknamed "The King of Cool". He was one of the biggest box-office draws of the 1960s and 1970s due to a popular "anti-hero" persona. He was born Terence Steven McQueen in Beech Grove, Indiana. His father was a stunt pilot for an aerial circus and abandoned Steve and his mother shortly after McQueen was born. His mother left him at an early age to be raised in Slater, Missouri by his Uncle Claude. At the age of 12, he was unhappily reunited with his mother and a new, abusive step-father and went to live with them in Los Angeles, California.

Selected quote







I come from teachers. My great, great grandfather Christopher Bayh came to Indiana with a yellow tag in his overalls that said, railroad. Because he couldn't speak any English, that's where he went to work. But his first grandson became a teacher and he married a teacher, my grandmother. No one here tonight would have traveled half as far if it weren't for our teachers. They're the real American heroes.
— Evan Bayh, 1996 Democratic Convention Keynote Speech
