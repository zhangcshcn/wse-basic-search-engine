Main Page Featured Portal drive completed !!![edit]

Wikipedia:Featured portal candidates/Main Page Featured Portal drive

The Main Page Featured Portal drive was successfully completed.
This was a collaborative initiative created to get all portals linked from the top-right of the Main Page to Featured Portal quality status.
Thank you to all who participated or contributed towards this quality improvement effort in some way.
Happy Holidays,

WikiCup 2015[edit]
Hi there; this is just a quick note to let you all know that the 2015 WikiCup will begin on January 1st. The WikiCup is an annual competition to encourage high-quality contributions to Wikipedia by adding a little friendly competition to editing. At the time of writing, more than fifty users have signed up to take part in the competition; interested parties, no matter their level of experience or their editing interests, are warmly invited to sign up. Questions are welcome on the WikiCup talk page. Thanks! Miyagawa (talk) 21:41, 29 December 2014 (UTC)

sports[edit]
A lot of the sports portals aren't listed are "Recreation and sports" on this page. - Yellow Dingo (talk) 01:13, 18 July 2016 (UTC)

@Yellow Dingo: This list is restricted to portals that have passed a strict quality check, as described at the top of the page. -- John of Reading (talk) 06:16, 18 July 2016 (UTC)



@John of Reading: Yeah I understand that; I guess I wasn't clear in what I meant. Some of the featured portals that are based on sport are listed on WP:FPO under Arts and culture (e.g. English football, Tennis, Ice hockey etc.). - Yellow Dingo (talk) 06:20, 18 July 2016 (UTC)

@Yellow Dingo: I've made an edit, but perhaps a better fix would be to lose the "Recreation and sports" subheading. The other subheadings mirror those at Portal:Contents/Portals, where the sports portals are listed under "Culture and the arts". Don't know! -- John of Reading (talk) 06:35, 18 July 2016 (UTC)



@John of Reading: OhanaUnited added the section here without consensus or moving any of the other qualifying articles to the section. I think we should keep Portal:Contents/Portals and WP:FPO the same but I'm not sure whether we should go with OhanaUnited or with the pre-existing format. - Yellow Dingo (talk) 10:24, 18 July 2016 (UTC)

@Yellow Dingo: The subheadings at Portal:Contents/Portals would be very difficult to change, as there are a whole set of inter-related pages there - eg Portal:Contents/Culture and the arts, Portal:Contents/Categories -- John of Reading (talk) 10:31, 18 July 2016 (UTC)

@John of Reading: Ok I would say we remove the "sports and recreation" sub heading at WP:FPO; put all the sport articles in their original grouping and put the Halo portal in "Arts and culture" (also where the sports will be). Do you agree? - Yellow Dingo (talk) 10:35, 18 July 2016 (UTC)

@Yellow Dingo: Yes, go ahead. -- John of Reading (talk) 10:41, 18 July 2016 (UTC)

@John of Reading:  Done - Yellow Dingo (talk) 10:45, 18 July 2016 (UTC)
