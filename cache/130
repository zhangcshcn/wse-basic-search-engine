Some Wikipedians have formed a project to better organize information in articles related to energy policy, production, technologies and sources. This refers only to energy as used by humans to do daily practical things, not physics concepts of energy in theory. It is a technology not a science project and intersects with economics and ecology topics.
This page and its subpages contain their suggestions; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians. If you would like to help, please inquire on the talk page and see the to-do list found there.

Information about the assessment of WP:Energy articles is located at Wikipedia:WikiProject Energy/Assessment.
Articles tagged (most likely by bot) with the WP:Energy banner, but still do not have an appropriate assessment, a listed in Category:Unassessed energy articles. Please consider to assess them.
Tagging energy article by bot[edit]
Articles automatically tagged by bot are listed in Category:Automatically assessed Energy articles. You are invited to confirm the bot assessment by removing the 'autotagged=yes' parameter from the project banner template or remove the project banner if the article is not belonging to the scope of the WP:Energy.

Tasks[edit]


edit · history · watch · refresh  To-do list for Wikipedia:WikiProject Energy:










Here are some tasks awaiting attention:

Article requests : Requested photos; Quantum power; Solution gas
Cleanup : Energy security; World energy resources and consumption; Energy; List of HVDC projects
Copyedit : Energy policy of Australia; Solar energy; Hydro-Québec
Expand : Associated petroleum gas, Energy policy of Saudi Arabia; Energy policy of China; Gas Oil Separation Plant; Geomelting; Petroleum industry; Energy policy of India; Energy in Norway; Energy policy of Venezuela; United States offshore drilling debate
Stubs : Category:Energy stubs
Verify : Energy market








Guidelines[edit]
Article title[edit]
Following Wikipedia standard, article titles should relate to the best-known name in most cases. However, this is somewhat complicated by the fact that there's a lot of ways to describe the desirability or purpose of different kinds of energy: "renewable", "non-nuclear", "sustainable", "non fossil", etc. These terms should be always avoided in titles in favour of a technically specific term that implies a kind of technology. Where one technology deals with many sources of energy, be careful, e.g. a turbine can burn many kinds of fuel, but a gasoline turbine only burns that one kind.
Redirects[edit]
To avoid the creation of duplicate articles, it is good to create a few redirects as soon as a new article is created. These should deal with all common variants, e.g. solar power versus solar energy.
Article format[edit]
A description of the required technology, the forms of energy converted (in physics terms, e.g. light to heat or to voltage), and power output under what circumstances should start every article in this category.
Categories[edit]

Category:Energy is the main category for this WikiProject.
Ownership categories can be made that help to organize proprietary technologies.
Category:Wikipedia requested photographs of energy subjects
