The New York State portal




New York /njuːˈjɔːrk/ is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the United States. New York City and Long Island are located on the southeastern-most part of lower New York State, and Upstate New York is in the north.
New York is bordered by Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; it shares a water border with Rhode Island, as well as an international border with the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario. New York is the United States' third most populous state.
The Algonquian, Iroquois, and Lenape Native American groups inhabited New York when Dutch and French nationals moved into the region in the early 17th century. First claimed by Henry Hudson in 1609, the region came to have Dutch forts in Fort Orange by 1614, near the site of the present-day state capital, Albany. The state was colonized by the Dutch in 1624, at both Albany and Manhattan; it later fell to British annexation in 1664. About one third of all of the battles of the Revolutionary War took place in New York. It became an independent state on July 9, 1776 and enacted its constitution in 1777. The state ratified the United States Constitution on July 26, 1788 to become the 11th state. According to the United States Department of Commerce, New York is the state of choice for foreign visitors, leading Florida and California in tourism.

The New York Islanders are a professional ice hockey team that plays in the NHL that is based in Uniondale, a hamlet located on Long Island in Town of Hempstead, Nassau County, New York, United States. The team is a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Islanders began play in 1972 and rapidly developed a dominant team that won four consecutive Stanley Cup championships in the early 1980s. They play their home games at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. With the impending start of the World Hockey Association (WHA) in the fall of 1972, the upstart league had plans to place its New York team in the brand-new Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Nassau County. However, Nassau County officials did not consider the WHA a major league and wanted nothing to do with the upstart New York Raiders. The only legal way to keep the Raiders out of the Coliseum was to get an NHL team to play there, so William Shea, who had helped bring the New York Mets to the area a decade earlier, was pressed into service once again.

The World Trade Center in New York City, United States, (sometimes informally referred to as the WTC or the Twin Towers) was a complex of seven buildings in Lower Manhattan, mostly designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki and engineer Leslie Robertson and developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It was initiated in 1960 by a Lower Manhattan Association created and chaired by David Rockefeller, who had the original idea of building the center, with strong backing from the then-New York governor, his brother Nelson Rockefeller.

Selected biography



Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was the twenty-second and twenty-fourth President of the United States. Cleveland is the only President to serve two non-consecutive terms (1885–1889 and 1893–1897). He was the winner of the popular vote for President three times—in 1884, 1888, and 1892—and was the only Democrat elected to the Presidency in the era of Republican political domination that lasted from 1860 to 1912. Cleveland's admirers praise him for his honesty, independence, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism. As a leader of the Bourbon Democrats, he opposed imperialism, taxes, subsidies and inflationary policies, but as a reformer he also worked against corruption, patronage, and bossism.
Some of Cleveland's actions caused controversy even within his own party. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 in order to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions, and his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democrats. Furthermore, critics complained that he had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term.

Troy is a city on the east bank of the Hudson River located a few miles north of the capital, Albany. Settled in 1707, Troy was incorporated as a village in 1787, as a town in 1791, and finally as a city in 1816. This photo is of Lansingburgh, an area of North Troy, which was founded as a separate town, but incorporated into the city of Troy in 1900. Troy is known as the "Collar City" for being a manufacturing center for shirts, shirtwaists, collars, and cuffs in the late 1800s. This photo is taken from Oakwood Cemetery, burial place of Sam Wilson, the origin of Uncle Sam.
