THE AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND PORTAL



















New Zealand (Aotearoa in te reo Māori) is a country of two large islands and many much smaller islands in the south-western Pacific Ocean. Among South Pacific nations, New Zealand has the largest and most industrialised economy and is second only to Papua New Guinea in population. It is situated some 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the Pacific island areas of Fiji and Tonga. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.
Queen Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand and is represented in the country by a governor-general. Legislative authority is vested in a democratically elected Parliament, while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister. The Realm of New Zealand also includes the self-governing Cook Islands and Niue, as well as Tokelau and New Zealand's claims in Antarctica.

The Huntly power station is the largest thermal power station in New Zealand and is located in the town of Huntly in the Waikato. It is operated by Genesis Power, a state-owned enterprise, and supplies around 17% of the country's power.
Each of the four main coal-fired units, installed in stages between 1973 and 1985, is capable of generating 250 MW (Megawatts) of electricity, giving the station a total generating capacity of 1000 MW, plus 50MW from a gas turbine commissioned in 2004. Its chimneys are 150 metres high and each chimney has two flues that are 7 metres in diameter.
The operator has recently (2004-2007) constructed a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant next to the existing station. This plant increased the total generating capacity of Huntly by 385 MW (250 MW gas turbine + 135 MW steam turbine). The new turbine is a NZ$ 520 million investment.
Huntly runs at a load factor of 85%, about twice what the best wind farms could achieve in New Zealand, and is currently used to provide a large amount of the baseline energy needs of the northern North Island - in other words, it is rarely running substantially below peak capacity.

Arthur's Pass is an alpine crossing of the Southern Alps of the South Island of New Zealand. It is at a height of 920 metres above sea level, and marks part of the boundary between Westland and Canterbury, 140 kilometres from Christchurch and 95 kilometres from Greymouth. The pass lies in a saddle between the valleys of the Otira River, a tributary of the Taramakau in the west and the Bealey River in the east.
