Featured articles in Wikipedia

Featured articles are considered to be the best articles Wikipedia has to offer, as determined by Wikipedia's editors. They are used by editors as examples for writing other articles. Before being listed here, articles are reviewed as featured article candidates for accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style according to our featured article criteria. There are 4,927 featured articles out of 5,334,175 articles on the English Wikipedia (~0.1% are featured). Thus, about one in 1,080 articles is listed here. Articles that no longer meet the criteria can be proposed for improvement or removal at featured article review.
On non-mobile versions of our website, a small bronze star icon () on the top right corner of an article's page indicates that the article is featured. Additionally, if the current article is featured in another language, a star will appear next to the corresponding entry in the Languages list in the sidebar (a user preference allows toggling this on/off under Gadgets > Appearance).
