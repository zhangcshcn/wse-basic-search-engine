Introduction


Welcome to the portal about Scouting and Guiding!





Scouting and Guiding is a worldwide youth movement composed of many organizations. Its aim is to develop young people physically, spiritually and mentally so that youth may take a constructive place in society. This is achieved through non-formal education with emphasis on practical activities in the outdoors, the so called Scout method. The Scout Movement was founded in 1907 by Robert Baden-Powell, a retired Lieutenant General in the British Army. He was also at that time a good friend of William Alexander Smith, Founder of the Boys' Brigade. Currently Scouting and Guiding have over 38 million members in 217 countries and territories represented through several different Scouting associations at the international level.

Selected article


The Vietnamese Scout Association (Vietnamese: Hội Hướng Đạo Việt Nam (HĐVN)) is a youth organization that was established in Vietnam and active between 1930 and 1975. The association was recognized by the World Organization of the Scout Movement from 1957 to 1975. Because of the political situation and war in Vietnam, it was banned in communist North Vietnam after 1954 and in the entire nation after the communist victory following the fall of Saigon. It presently exists in exile, and is reforming within Vietnam itself. There are reports of clandestine Scouting activities in Vietnam dating from 1994 and 2002. Vietnam is the largest nation in population to have Scouting that is not recognized by WOSM.

Selected biography


Dr. Rudolf Plajner (April 5, 1901 in Prostějov – June 23, 1987) was declared the Chief Scout of the newly unified Czech Scouts and Guides association called Junák, after its inception on January 22, 1939. Junák was abolished by force and Scouting prohibited by German State Secretary Karl Hermann Frank during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia on October 28, 1940. After World War II, the association was reborn. His function was confirmed at the third Junák council or meeting (cs:sněm) in 1968, and served in this function until the end of his life. Plajner took part in building Defense of the Nation (cs:Obrana národa) and in other resistance organizations. He was arrested in 1943, and released after two months. He again joined the Czech resistance to Nazi occupation and cooperated with guerilla brigade "Jan Žižka". After the war Plajner received several honors and Junák started to work again in 1945, but in 1948 was included in the Socialist Youth Union (cs:Socialistický svaz mládeže, SSM), the Czechoslovakian Communist youth organisation, and dissolved in 1950. Plajner was arrested and imprisoned shortly in 1949 in Uherské Hradiště. Junák shortly renewed its existence between 1968 and 1970 after the Prague Spring. Later in this period he received several state and Scout awards due to his work for the Scouting movement, including the Silver Wolf.
