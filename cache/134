Telecommunications

Project

Devoted to improving coverage of telecommunications on Wikipedia.









Noticeboard












Welcome!




Some Wikipedians have formed a project to better organize and coordinate articles related to telecommunications. This project strives to provide a foundation for collaboration among editors interested in anything that is within its scope. We'd like to create standards for good telecommunications articles, and help improve Wikiepedia's coverage of the field. If you are interested in anything from semaphore to smartphones, please help us out! To register yourself as a participant of the project, simply add your name to the roster below. Happy editing!




Getting started




There are a few things you can do right now to get assist the project:

Add yourself to the roster of participants.
Monitor the discussion on the project's talk page.
Take a look at the watchlist and monitor the log of assessment changes.
Add {{User WikiProject Tel}} to your user page. It will automatically add you to the member’s category.






Scope and goals




This project aims to improve Wikipedia's articles on all aspects of telecommunications. This includes the history of different types of telecommunications, as well as new developments in telecommunication technology. The project also seeks to improve existing articles related to field, and to provide reliable, third-party sources to verify them. In so doing, the project hopes to improve the readability of telecommunications articles, many of which can be very technical. Furthermore, it is essential that project members work with our sister projects to coordinate the writing of new telecommunications articles.
