 Administrator intervention against vandalism




Shortcuts:

This page is intended for reports about obvious and persistent vandals and spammers only. Before posting here, please read the spam and vandalism pages, as well as the AIV guide. To submit a report, edit this page and follow the instructions at the top of the "User-reported" section. For other issues that require administrators, file an external request for administrator attention.








Important! Please remember the following:










The edits of the reported user must be obvious vandalism or obvious spam.
The user must have been given enough warnings to stop their disruptive behavior.
The warnings must have been given recently and the users must be active now, especially for unregistered users.
The appropriate vandal template should be used if you decide that a report should be filed.

For logged-in users only: It should look like: *{{vandal|Example user}} concise reason e.g. vandalised past 4th warning. ~~~~
For IP users only: it should look like: *{{IPvandal|127.0.0.1}} concise reason e.g. vandalised past 4th warning. ~~~~


Requests for further sanctions against a blocked user (e.g., talk page, e-mail blocks) should go to Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents, as a bot automatically removes accounts here that are blocked.
Reports of sockpuppetry should be made at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations unless the connection between the accounts is obvious and disruption is recent and ongoing.

GetItRightFirstTime (talk • contribs • deleted contribs • nuke contribs • logs • edit filter log • block user • block log) – On Bleana: account is evidently a spambot or a compromised account. COI editing by the PR company of the artist (see this edit on talk page: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GetItRightFirstTime&diff=prev&oldid=643300771). Karst (talk) 00:13, 13 February 2017 (UTC)

Wilshire01 (talk • contribs • deleted contribs • nuke contribs • logs • edit filter log • block user • block log) repeatedly removes valid content on Lichfield Gospels under false claims of copyright concern. Full explanation offered on article talk page. Blackstache (talk) 06:54, 13 February 2017 (UTC)
Gabrielhelewa81 (talk • contribs • deleted contribs • nuke contribs • logs • edit filter log • block user • block log) – Actions indicate a promotion-only account. User has been warned since November 2016 (see their talk page) about creating now-deleted articles for themselves, despite not being notable, which reads like spam. They have added information about their own release to List of 2017 albums twice and been reverted twice now, but I have only began warning them; however, such blatant, repeated self-promotion (including with now-deleted edits) usually results in a block. Ss112 07:52, 13 February 2017 (UTC)
NewMoonGuy (talk • contribs • deleted contribs • nuke contribs • logs • edit filter log • block user • block log) – On Dreams Not Reality: actions evidently indicate a vandalism-only account. Already blocked before, since then only vandalizing a couple of files, thats all, no creative edits at all. Dan Koehl (talk) 08:17, 13 February 2017 (UTC)
Mrinfotech (talk • contribs • deleted contribs • nuke contribs • logs • edit filter log • block user • block log) – account is being used only for promotional purposes. Cahk (talk) 08:57, 13 February 2017 (UTC)
JohnGolt (talk • contribs • deleted contribs • nuke contribs • logs • edit filter log • block user • block log) – spam-only account. Jim1138 (talk) 09:21, 13 February 2017 (UTC)
