Unless you're okay with repetitive strain injury, it's best you get comfortable with the wealth of tools out there to assist you with administrative tasks. Getting the job done faster means less stress for you, smaller backlogs, and hence better overall stability of the project.

General

Twinkle – Offers a wealth of powerful administrative tools. More info in the sections below.
MoreMenu – Adds up to two drop-down menus to the menu bar containing links to useful common tasks, user/page logs, analytic tools/statistics, and tools for administrators.
Popups – provides a small pop-up window when hovering over links and has a list of option including (un)block/delete/protect.

Rollback
Main page: Wikipedia:Administrators' guide/Rollback

Twinkle – Provides "good-faith revert", "rollback", and "rollback (vandal)" links when viewing the diff of the most recent edit to a page
massRollback – Rollback all edits made by a particular user. Proceed with caution!

Protecting
Main page: Wikipedia:Administrators' guide/Protecting

Twinkle – A comprehensive (un)protect+template tool. Allows you to choose a preset that auto-supplies the standard protect settings for a given scenario. If the page has been protected in the past, a link will be shown to the protect log or pending changes log accordingly.

Batch-protect: Click on the "P-batch" link to activate Twinkle's batch protect feature, allowing you to protect multiple pages at once. The module loads all links on the current page and lets you select which ones to protect. For instance, to protect all pages in your userspace, you can generate the page of links with Special:PrefixIndex/Example. To batch protect a specific group of pages (for example multiple articles arising from the same RfPP request), you can create a page in your userspace that contains a link to each of the pages you want to protect.

Blocking
Main page: Wikipedia:Administrators' guide/Blocking
Executing blocks

Twinkle – A comprehensive block+template tool. Allows you to choose a preset that auto-supplies the standard block duration, block summary, and template to issue to the user. You will see different presets and options when blocking IPs versus accounts. You can also use this gadget just to template the user and not block, and vice versa. If the user has been blocked in the past, a link to the block log will be shown. Also automatically disables a hard block when blocking bots.
EasyBlock – Block+template script with numerous options on types of blocks. This is quicker than Twinkle but does not allow you to choose block options. Many admins use both scripts.
massblock – Block multiple users at once. Use with caution!
Note you can also block while patrolling recent changes with Huggle

WHOIS

Domaintools – Probably the most comprehensive of the WHOIS tools, however requires you enter a CAPTCHA and has a limit of about 50 lookups a day. Be sure to check not just the ASN but the network name, etc, when attempting to determine if an IP belongs to a school or is otherwise shared.
Whois Gateway on labs – free, CAPTCHA-less and limitless WHOIS lookups for IPs. May not show the network name in some situations.
Betacommand's WHOIS tool – returns the ASN and CIDR range for an IP, checks for global blocks and returns the block log. To use, append the IP to the URL like ?ip=1.2.3.4
For an up-to-date list of the most commons tools used when checking IPs, refer to {{anontools}}, passing it an IPv6 address if needed.

Range blocks
General information

mw:Help:Range blocks, help on MediaWiki
mw:Help:Range blocks/IPv6, IPv6 help

Calculating a range

NativeForeigner's range calculator
Rangeblock-Calculator on labs
Subnet-calculator.com
Gestioip.net

Checking range contributions

Contribsrange gadget (preferred) – enable "Allow /16, /24 and /27 – /32 CIDR ranges" at Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets under "Advanced". Then type in any CIDR range into Special:Contribs. You can also do a prefix search, e.g. 83.217.178* would search for all accounts prefixed with 83.217.178
xtools on labs. For larger ranges this may be needed over the gadget

Deleting
Main page: Wikipedia:Administrators' guide/Deleting
Deleting pages

Twinkle – Allows you to delete a page and optionally its talk page, all the redirects to that page, and even unlink any links to that page. Ability to delete under multiple criteria is now supported

Batch-delete: Click on the "D-batch" link to activate Twinkle's batch delete feature, allowing you to delete multiple pages at once. The module loads all links on the current page and lets you select which ones to delete, along with options to also delete their talk pages, redirects to those pages, and removing links to those pages. Very useful for instance when closing a discussion at WP:AfD as delete, where you need to delete all pages in a category. You can also use Special:PrefixIndex to generate a list of subpages of a page, and then use D-batch to delete all of them.


SpamUserPage (WP:SUPG) – Allows you to delete a userspace page, block the user, and issue them with a block notice, all in one click, with options for types of blocks, deletion rationale, etc.
spamublock – Delete a userpage, block the user, and issue {{uw-spamublock}} with one click
User:Mr. Stradivarius/gadgets/Draftify (WP:DFY) – allows you to move a userspace draft to the draft namespace without a redirect (deleting the userpage), tag the new draft with a draft template, and notify the user of your action
Special:Nuke – MediaWiki-provided tool to selectively delete all pages created by a user.

Deleting revisions

massRevdel – Selectively revdel/suppress all edits by a user

Granting and revoking user rights
Main page: Wikipedia:Administrators' guide/Granting and revoking user rights
Executing user rights changes

User:MusikAnimal/userRightsManager.js - for use at WP:PERM. Click "assign permissions" on any PERM page, enter any closing remarks in the popup dialog, and the script will grant the right with a permalink to the discussion, and issue the corresponding talk page template.
User:Amalthea/MakeAutopatroller.js - provides a link on userpages to make the user autopatrolled; notifies the user with a template.
User:Amalthea/MakeReviewer.js - provides a link on userpages to give the user reviewer rights; notifies the user with a template.
User:Amalthea/MakeRollbacker.js - provides a link on userpages to give the user rollback rights; notifies the user with a template.
