Iceland i/ˈaɪslənd/ (Icelandic: Ísland, IPA: [ˈislant]) is a Nordic European island country in the North Atlantic Ocean, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The country has a population of about 320,000 and a total area of 103,000 km2 (40,000 sq mi). The capital and largest city is Reykjavík, with the surrounding areas in the southwestern region of the country being home to two-thirds of the country's population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior mainly consists of a plateau characterised by sand fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle.
The country is sometimes erroneously called The Republic of Iceland and sometimes its counterpart Lýðveldið Ísland in Icelandic, but the official name is rather like the official name of Canada - simply the country name. One example of the former is the name of the Constitution of Iceland, which in Icelandic is Stjórnarskrá lýðveldisins Íslands and literally means "the Constitution of the republic of Iceland", but note that "republic" is not capitalized. The official title of the President of Iceland (Forseti Íslands) does also not include the word republic as in some other republics. See also Names for Iceland.

Selected article



Bolli Bollason was a key historical character in the Medieval Icelandic Laxdœla saga, born around 1006 in Orlygsstadir, at Helgafell on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. He was held in the highest regard among the contemporary Scandinavian rulers, and also in the Byzantine Empire, where he became the first known West Norseman in the Varangian Guard. It is believed that he had reached the rank of "Manglabites" in the Byzantine army, and on his return to Iceland, his finery and recognition earned him the name "Bolli the Elegant".
His importance in the literary context of the saga is his prominence as the son of Bolli Þorleiksson and Guðrún Ósvífursdóttir, the two central characters of the work. In addition to this role, his own tale, the Bollaþáttur, was later appended to the end of the manuscripts in the early 14th century.

The Icelandic horse is a breed of horse that has lived in Iceland since the mid-800s, brought to the island by Viking settlers. It originated from pony breeds taken from Scandinavian and European countries to Iceland during the original and subsequent settlements but has now been bred for centuries without the addition of outside bloodstock.

Selected biography


Vigdís Finnbogadóttir (born 15 April 1930) was the fourth president of Iceland, serving from 1980 to 1996. She was the world's first elected female president. She was Iceland's first and so far only female president and head of state. In 1980 she was the first woman in the world to be elected the head of state in a democratic election. She was narrowly elected over three male opponents. She was subsequently reelected three times (in 1984, in 1992, and overwhelmingly in 1988), before retiring in 1996. Although the Icelandic presidency is largely a ceremonial position, she took an active role in promoting the country as a cultural ambassador and enjoyed great popularity. Currently, she is a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, and a Member of the Club of Madrid.

Selected quote







Genetic studies in Iceland have found that many of the women who were the founding stock of Iceland came from England and what is now France. Some were probably captured and carried off in Viking raids only 40 generations ago.
— Keith Henson
