Note: pages permanently protected because of visibility or legal reasons are now listed separately at Wikipedia:List of indefinitely protected pages.
Note: pages protected as a {{deletedpage}} or redirect to another page are now listed separately at Wikipedia:List of pages protected against re-creation.
Note: You can request protection and unprotection at Wikipedia:Requests for page protection.

Administrators have the ability to "protect" pages or images so that they cannot be modified except by other admins (the link "މި ޞަފްޙާއަށް އުނިއިތުރު ގެންނަވާ" is replaced by a link "މަސްދަރު ބައްލަވާ" when viewed by non-admins). This ability is only to be used in limited circumstances.
Admins must not protect pages they are actively engaged in editing, except in the case of simple vandalism.


Articles linked from the main page should NOT be protected (full or semi) except to clean up vandalism. Protection should be kept to 10-15 minutes in these cases.

If you add an article here, please remember to check the talk page frequently, and always consider removing protection as soon as possible.

ފަންވަތް:Article and ފަންވަތް:Article are protected, apparently as part of the "experimental" process on Wikipedia:Stable versions. This strikes me as rather dubious, but at at any rate it should presumably be done transparently, hence I'm listing here. Alai 02:14, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

I rejected the request myself and nothing has changed since then. Sigh. I don't care if it's stable or not. I'm against protecting pages just to protect them, which is what this feels like. No one has touched them outside of legit editors. If they become high risk and high profile, fine, then protect, but right now it feels like a waste of protection. --Woohookitty(cat scratches) 05:37, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

ފަންވަތް:Ln One editor making repeated tiny edits to heavily used template. Have left note on editor's page, suggesting he needs to work on a copy in the sandbox, rather than on the template itself. Should think this only needs to be a brief protection. 00:42, 25 December 2005 (UTC)
ފަންވަތް:Ln: Edit war on whether to link to a list of times the admin has been blocked. — FREAK OF NURxTURE (TALK) 03:56, Jan. 8, 2006
ފަންވަތް:Ln: Edit war on the icon: flag or map. The map doesn't look right, but the flag is a problem for political reasons. For now, it has no icon - hopefully a equitable solution will be found soon, but the temperature is more than a little warm on the talk page. Grutness...wha? 05:15, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
ފަންވަތް:Article - full protection from Ardenn (talk • contribs) changing the closing admin's decision text. I'll remove the protection in 15 minutes when Ardenn has cooled down, hopefully. Update - Not sure the user has agreed to not change it if I unprotect, so leaving protected for now. Should be minimal inpact, since it shouldnt be being changed anyhow. --Syrthiss 22:03, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
Image:Turks2.jpg - edit war on Turkish people spilled over to this image. howcheng {chat} 00:35, 1 February 2006 (UTC)
Image:Jyllands-Posten Muhammad drawings.jpg - a hugely controversial image undergoing repeated vandalism from multiple sources. This will almost certainly need to be protected for a long time - perhaps permanently, given the degree of animosity involved. -- ChrisO 21:47, 1 February 2006 (UTC)




Image talk:Jyllands-Posten Muhammad drawings.jpg - somewhat unusually, I've also had to protect the image's talk page; it's been picking up some very ugly comments of the kind which Jimbo blanked from the main article's talk page. Users are now redirected to Talk:Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy if they wish to discuss the image. Again, this will require long-term protection. -- ChrisO 09:57, 5 February 2006 (UTC)




Category:Chinese_newspapers - many edits in this category which was voted for deletion are being used as evidence in a pending arbitration case. I restored the deletion and protected the page while the case is being deliberated.

ފަންވަތް:Ln: Semiprotected. Talk header template with moderate visibility, repeatedly vandalized by anons. —Ilmari Karonen (talk) 03:47, 8 February 2006 (UTC)

Images protected while on the Main Page[އުނިއިތުރު ގެންނަވާ]
Images on the main page often become the target of vandalism, particularly being overwritten with shock site images, which harms the credibility of the project due to that page's extreme visibility. Also, it takes some time for sysops to determine what caused a main page change. As such, images have begun to be protected during their time there, and this has become a de facto policy since the second or third week of November 2004.
In order to keep track of these images, please add {{ProtectedMainPageImage}} to them. This will add the image to Category:Protected main page images. There are typically 4 to 5 images on the main page, although some of them may be from the Wikicommons.
Protected user pages[އުނިއިތުރު ގެންނަވާ]
User pages sometimes become targets for vandalism, and may be protected upon request of the user associated with the page if this is a serious problem. Clear evidence can be seen from a user's history of the page, and their history from their discussion page.
By software configuration, script files (*.js) and stylesheets (*.css) in user spaces are protected such that only the user or an administrator can edit it.
Full protection[އުނިއިތުރު ގެންނަވާ]

User talk pages: Registered users[އުނިއިތުރު ގެންނަވާ]
User talk pages should only be protected in cases of persistent vandalism, and then only for as brief a period as possible. Please use the template

{{Usertalk-sprotect}} to mark such pages. This adds the page to Category:Semi-protected user and user talk pages.

User talk pages: Anonymous users[އުނިއިތުރު ގެންނަވާ]
Talk pages of anonymous users should generally only be semi-protected. This prevents a vandal from blanking warnings etc., but still allows non-admin RC patrollers to issue warnings on this page. Please use the template
{{Usertalk-sprotect}} to mark such pages. This adds the page to Category:Semi-protected user and user talk pages. Please use the

{{vandal}} tag (replacing " " with "_" as appropriate).
