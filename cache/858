This article is about definition of a substring. For the computer function which performs this operation, see String functions (programming).
A substring of a string 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 is another string 




S
′



{\displaystyle S'}

 that occurs "in" 



S


{\displaystyle S}

. For example, "the best of" is a substring of "It was the best of times". This is not to be confused with subsequence, which is a generalization of substring. For example, "Itwastimes" is a subsequence of "It was the best of times", but not a substring.
Prefix and suffix are special cases of substring. A prefix of a string 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 is a substring of 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 that occurs at the beginning of 



S


{\displaystyle S}

. A suffix of a string 



S


{\displaystyle S}

 is a substring that occurs at the end of 



S


{\displaystyle S}

.

Substring[edit]
A substring (or factor) of a string 



T
=

t

1


…

t

n




{\displaystyle T=t_{1}\dots t_{n}}

 is a string 






T
^



=

t

1
+
i


…

t

m
+
i




{\displaystyle {\hat {T}}=t_{1+i}\dots t_{m+i}}

, where 



0
≤
i


{\displaystyle 0\leq i}

 and 



m
+
i
≤
n


{\displaystyle m+i\leq n}

. A substring of a string is a prefix of a suffix of the string, and equivalently a suffix of a prefix. If 






T
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {T}}}

 is a substring of 



T


{\displaystyle T}

, it is also a subsequence, which is a more general concept. Given a pattern 



P


{\displaystyle P}

, you can find its occurrences in a string 



T


{\displaystyle T}

 with a string searching algorithm. Finding the longest string which is equal to a substring of two or more strings is known as the longest common substring problem.
Example: The string ana is equal to substrings (and subsequences) of banana at two different offsets:

banana
 |||||
 ana||
   |||
   ana

In the mathematical literature, substrings are also called subwords (in America) or factors (in Europe).
Not including the empty substring, the number of substrings of a string of length 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 where symbols only occur once, is the number of ways to choose two distinct places between symbols to start/end the substring. Including the very beginning and very end of the string, there are 



n
+
1


{\displaystyle n+1}

 such places. So there are 







(



n
+
1

2


)




=




n
(
n
+
1
)

2





{\displaystyle {\tbinom {n+1}{2}}={\tfrac {n(n+1)}{2}}}

 non-empty substrings.
Prefix[edit]
A prefix of a string 



T
=

t

1


…

t

n




{\displaystyle T=t_{1}\dots t_{n}}

 is a string 






T
^



=

t

1


…

t

m




{\displaystyle {\widehat {T}}=t_{1}\dots t_{m}}

, where 



m
≤
n


{\displaystyle m\leq n}

. A proper prefix of a string is not equal to the string itself (



0
≤
m
<
n


{\displaystyle 0\leq m<n}

);[1] some sources[2] in addition restrict a proper prefix to be non-empty (



0
<
m
<
n


{\displaystyle 0<m<n}

). A prefix can be seen as a special case of a substring.
Example: The string ban is equal to a prefix (and substring and subsequence) of the string banana:

banana
|||
ban

The square subset symbol is sometimes used to indicate a prefix, so that 






T
^



⊑
T


{\displaystyle {\widehat {T}}\sqsubseteq T}

 denotes that 






T
^





{\displaystyle {\widehat {T}}}

 is a prefix of 



T


{\displaystyle T}

. This defines a binary relation on strings, called the prefix relation, which is a particular kind of prefix order.
In formal language theory, the term prefix of a string is also commonly understood to be the set of all prefixes of a string, with respect to that language. See the article on string functions for more details.
Suffix[edit]
A suffix of a string is any substring of the string which includes its last letter, including itself. A proper suffix of a string is not equal to the string itself. A more restricted interpretation is that it is also not empty[1]. A suffix can be seen as a special case of a substring.
Example: The string nana is equal to a suffix (and substring and subsequence) of the string banana:

banana
  ||||
  nana

A suffix tree for a string is a trie data structure that represents all of its suffixes. Suffix trees have large numbers of applications in string algorithms. The suffix array is a simplified version of this data structure that lists the start positions of the suffixes in alphabetically sorted order; it has many of the same applications.
Border[edit]
A border is suffix and prefix of the same string, e.g. "bab" is a border of "babab" (and also of "babooneatingakebab").
Superstring[edit]
Given a set of 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 strings 



P
=
{

s

1


,

s

2


,

s

3


,
…

s

k


}


{\displaystyle P=\{s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},\dots s_{k}\}}

, a superstring of the set 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 is single string that contains every string in 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 as a substring. For example, a concatenation of the strings of 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 in any order gives a trivial superstring of 



P


{\displaystyle P}

. For a more interesting example, let 



P
=
{

abcc

,

efab

,

bccla

}


{\displaystyle P=\{{\text{abcc}},{\text{efab}},{\text{bccla}}\}}

. Then 




bcclabccefab



{\displaystyle {\text{bcclabccefab}}}

 is a superstring of 



P


{\displaystyle P}

, and 




efabccla



{\displaystyle {\text{efabccla}}}

 is another, shorter superstring of 



P


{\displaystyle P}

. Generally, we are interested in finding superstrings whose length is small.[clarification needed]
