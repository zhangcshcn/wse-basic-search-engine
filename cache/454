This is a maintenance category. It is used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project and is not part of the encyclopedia. It contains pages that are not articles, or it groups articles by status rather than content. Do not include this category in content categories.
This is a hidden category. It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference 'Show hidden categories' is set.



This category contains portals which have been semi-protected in line with the Wikipedia:Protection policy. Semi-protection prevents a portal from being edited by anonymous and newly registered users.
To add a portal to this category, use {{pp-semi-protected}} or one of the more specific semi-protection templates. This should only be done if the portal is in fact semi-protected.
Note that adding the template does not in itself protect the portal. Conversely, protecting the page does not automatically add the template (or any other visible protected-page category linkages), which results in some pages having a "view source"-tab instead of "edit this page" and yet not showing "Semi-protected" at the bottom -- a situation new users may find rather confusing. Therefore, it is best to always add the template immediately after protecting the page.
