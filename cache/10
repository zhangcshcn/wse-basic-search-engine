The chemistry portal

P:CHEM





Welcome to the chemistry portal. Chemistry is a branch of science. Modern chemistry focuses on the study of elements of the world and the bonds between elements. Chemistry also deals with composition, structure, and properties of substances and the transformations that they undergo. The study of chemistry can help people to make new materials. In the study of matter, chemistry also investigates its interactions with energy and itself. Chemistry doesn't just explain the Chemical properties of matter, but also explains almost all Physical properties of matter such as density, hardness, electrical conductivity, flexibility, melting points etc. Therefore understanding basic Chemistry will also help understand many physical phenomena. Because of the diversity of matter, which is mostly in the form of compounds, chemists often study how atoms of different chemical elements interact to form molecules, and how molecules interact with each other. However not just ordinary chemical reactions involving the transference of electrons is studied, but in some fields such as Nuclear Chemistry, Physical Chemistry and Inorganic Chemistry also Nuclear reactions are studied.

Raney nickel is a solid catalyst composed of fine grains of a nickel-aluminium alloy, used in many industrial processes. It was developed in 1926 by American engineer Murray Raney as an alternative catalyst for the hydrogenation of vegetable oils in industrial processes. More recently it is used as a heterogeneous catalyst in a variety of organic syntheses, most commonly for hydrogenation reactions.
Raney nickel is produced when a block of nickel-aluminium alloy is treated with concentrated sodium hydroxide. This treatment, called "activation", dissolves most of the aluminium out of the alloy. The porous structure left behind has a large surface area, which gives high catalytic activity. A typical catalyst is around 85-percent nickel by mass, corresponding to about two atoms of nickel for every atom of aluminium. The aluminium which remains helps to preserve the pore structure of the overall catalyst.
Since Raney is a registered trademark of W. R. Grace and Company, only those products by its Grace Davison division are properly called "Raney nickel". Alternatively, the more generic terms "skeletal catalyst" or "sponge-metal catalyst" may be used to refer to catalysts that have physical and chemical properties similar to those of Raney nickel.

Gallium is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Ga and atomic number 31. A rare, soft silvery metallic poor metal, gallium is a brittle solid at low temperatures but liquefies slightly above room temperature and indeed will melt in the hand. It occurs in trace amounts in bauxite and zinc ores. An important application is in the compound gallium arsenide, used as a semiconductor, most notably in light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

History and Philosophy of Chemistry



Many chemists have an interest in the history of chemistry. Those with philosophical interests will be interested that the philosophy of chemistry has quite recently developed along a path somewhat different from the general philosophy of science.
Other articles that might interest you are:

There is a Wikipedia Project on the History of Science and a portal for the philosophy of science.

Selected biography



Hermann Emil Fischer (1852-1919) was a German chemist, and recipient of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1902. Many consider Fischer to be the most brilliant chemist who ever lived, because of his numerous contributions to science, especially chemistry and biochemistry. Among these is his discovery of phenylhydrazine. He also undertook vast studies on purines. This work showed that various substances such as adenine, xanthine, caffeine, uric acid, and guanine, all belonged to one homogeneous family, and could be derived from one another. He reasoned this to be due to their common origins from a parent molecule, a bicyclic nitrogenous structure into which the characteristic urea group entered. Fischer regarded this structure as hypothetical, and named it 'purine' in 1884. He synthesised it in 1898. He is also famed for his work on sugars.
