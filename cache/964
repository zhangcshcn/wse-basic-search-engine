Category:Wikipedia move-protected project pages

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search




This is a maintenance category. It is used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project and is not part of the encyclopedia. It contains pages that are not articles, or it groups articles by status rather than content. Do not include this category in content categories.
This is a hidden category. It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference 'Show hidden categories' is set.



This category contains project pages which have been protected from page moves. They can still be moved by administrators. Fully protected pages – those listed in Category:Wikipedia protected pages and its subcategories – are also move-protected; they are protected from both editing and moves.
Use {{pp-move}} or {{pp-move-indef}} to add pages to this category. This should only be done if the page is in fact protected – adding the template does not in itself protect the page.
