You employ stone, wood and concrete, and with these materials you build houses and palaces: that is construction. Ingenuity is at work. But suddenly you touch my heart, you do me good. I am happy and I say: "This is beautiful. That is Architecture. Art enters in..." Le Corbusier, Vers une architecture, 1923





Are you interested in architecture? Do you think it is important to impart knowledge about architecture? Then we would like to invite you to help us in this project.
This project develops ideas about how we might organise data in articles about architecture. These are only suggestions, things to give you focus and to get you going, and you shouldn't feel obligated in the least to follow them. But if you don't know what to write or where to begin, following the guidelines below may be helpful. First and foremost, we simply invite you to write articles.

Scope[edit]
This WikiProject aims to:

Thoroughly explore Architecture, buildings, construction globally and historically.
Improve articles about architecture, architects, buildings and construction.
Provide a place to discuss common issues on architecture, buildings, construction related pages.
Organise and categorise Category:Architecture
Ensure all pages meet the standards of Wikipedia:Cite sources. See also WikiProject Fact and Reference Check.
Develop standards and templates for architecture, buildings, construction related articles.
Manage editing of the Architecture WikiPortal






How to contribute[edit]
Improve Outline of architecture[edit]
The outline of architecture is a centralized navigation hub for the subject of architecture. It is intended to summarize the entire subject of architecture and Wikipedia's coverage of it. In turn, it is part of Wikipedia's outline system which is one of Wikipedia's contents systems.
Please look it over and fill-in missing topics and pictures. If Wikipedia has an article or article section about those topics, please add links to them.
While browsing the outline, please answer the following questions (and fix the outline as needed):

What's missing? (Among other things: pictures! Showcase the best buildings!)
Is the structure of the outline (sections and indents) representative of the subject?
Does the outline help understand the relationships between the topics presented in the best way possible?

The overall purpose of the outline is to help readers comprehend the subject by showing what belongs to it, and within the subject what belongs to what.
The outline is intended to be a taxonomy of the subject, and also serves as a table of contents and navigation aid to browse Wikipedia's articles (and article sections) about the subject.
It is also a useful tool for this WikiProject to analyze, plan, develop, and revise architectural articles. It is a hub from which to organize architecture-related topics.
It was built as a "reverse outline", a structural model of existing work, which in addition to being a summary of the work, can reveal the gaps and other weaknesses for revision purposes.

Help for authors[edit]
Create new articles[edit]

Relevance: Is the article you want to create relevant or important for the Wikipedia? - see Wikipedia:Importance
Naming: Generally: use the common name! - See Wikipedia:Naming conventions (architecture)

Using starter templates[edit]
The starter templates listed below can assist you by setting up standard headings and infoboxes in your article. To use them follow this procedure:

Create a blank article having first considered the information above concerning naming conventions and relevance.
Copy one of the following templates and use it to start the article:

Architect template for articles about architects
Modern building template for articles about buildings begun on or after 1900
Historic building template for articles about buildings begun before 1900


Save the article
Edit the article again, and add the text for your article under the headings that are created.

Infoboxes[edit]
The starter templates above are embedded with the following infoboxes than can be inserted separately into an article - this is not compulsory - often architecture articles are better first illustrated by other means:

Please use the Template:Infobox architect for writing an article about an architect.
Use the Template:Infobox building for an article about a specific building.
Please use Template:Infobox bridge for a bridge structure.
See Wikipedia:WikiProject Architecture/infobox for a full list of architecture Infoboxes, including instructions on usage and examples.

Templates to organise a series of articles[edit]
Use these series box templates for articles about:

{{History of architecture}} Architectural history
{{Modern architecture}} Modern architecture use
{{Postmodernism}} Postmodern architecture
Add the {{WikiProject Architecture}} template to the top of the Talk page for articles about architects and important topics in architecture, notable buildings and structures or anything else related to this WikiProject. For more information, see Article assessment below. Template will display the following:

Pages needing attention[edit]
Refer to: Wikipedia:Pages needing attention/Architecture Categories and articles for cleanup, expansion needed, expert attention, Wikification, neutrality in question and articles to be merged or split

American architecture lacks references, although otherwise and reasonably well-written and coherent.

Top-level articles that fail to provide an adequate overview of the subject. Most of these are hopelessly incomplete and / or unbalanced, and fail to provide even a competent guide to coverage of the subject elsewhere in Wikipedia. Wide-ranging expert knowledge and some research would be needed to get these to a decent standard.

Classical architecture
French architecture
Georgian architecture
Victorian architecture
History of construction

Structural elements articles, relatively easy to put right and very much in need of attention:

Arch
Atrium
Beam
Buttress
Cantilever
Column
Dome
Facade
Pier (architecture)
Post and lintel
Rain gutter and Leader Head disputed naming as well as poor coverage of the subject.
Span
Truss
Vault
Wall
