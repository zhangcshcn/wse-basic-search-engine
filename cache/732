WARNING: The Book Creator software has had significant limitations since it was rebuilt in 2014, the management process is starved of resources, and most fixes are a long way off.
Information in this page may relate to an earlier version, but many previous features are not currently available. These include rendering of tables, infoboxes, galleries and math markup, and most output options. The app is also prone to crashing with a "Status: Rendering process died with non zero code" error message. Some tips are available at Help:Books/Feedback.
An alternative open source MediaWiki-to-LaTeX compiler is experimentally available, see https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf .
Status last updated 5 August 2016.





Overview

A Wikipedia Book is an organized collection of Wikipedia articles that can be rendered electronically in PDF format, or ordered as a printed book. The book is compiled afresh each time it is downloaded or ordered, so will always reflect the latest versions of the articles.
Note: Currently (2017) not all information in an article will be displayed when rendered in book format - in particular, since 2014 information held in tables (including infoboxes) has not been displayed. Nor has maths markup.
For information and help on Wikipedia books in general, see Help:Books (general tips) and WikiProject Wikipedia-Books (questions and assistance).
