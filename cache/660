The cats portal



The family Felidae (the felids) includes the lion, the tiger, the domestic cat, and other felines as its members. All of the fifteen families in the order Carnivora are recognized as obligate carnivores lacking the necessary enzymes required for the digestion and metabolism of plant matter. The first felids emerged during the Eocene, about 40 million years ago. The most familiar feline is the domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus), which first became associated with humans about 10,000 years ago. Its wild relative, the wildcat, still lives in Europe, Africa and western Asia, although habitat destruction has restricted their range.
The domestic cat (or simply "cat", although the term can refer to all felids) is a small carnivorous mammal descended from the African wildcat. The cat is a skilled predator and intelligent animal, known to hunt over 1,000 species for food, and intelligent enough that it can be trained (and can learn by itself) to obey simple commands and manipulate simple mechanisms. It has lived in close association with humans for at least 9,500 years, figuring prominently in the mythology and legends of many cultures.

The Cheetah (derived from Sanskrit word Chitraka meaning "Speckled") (Acinonyx jubatus) is an atypical member of the cat family (Felidae) that hunts by speed rather than by stealth or pack tactics. It is the fastest of all land animals and can reach speeds of up to 70 mph (120 km/h) in short bursts up to 500 yards (500 m), as well as being able to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.5 seconds.
The cheetah is a vulnerable species. Out of all the big cats, it is the least able to adapt to new environments. They have always proved difficult to breed in captivity, but recently a few zoos have been successful. Once widely shot for its fur, the cheetah now suffers more from the loss of both habitat and prey.

Selected breed


Savannahs are cats produced by crossbreeding Servals and domestic cats. The coat of a Savannah depends a lot on the breed of cat used for the domestic cross. Early generations have some form of dark spotting on a lighter coat, and many breeders employ "wild" looking spotted breeds such as the Bengal and Egyptian Mau for the cross to help preserve these markings in later generations. An often noted trait of the Savannah is its jumping ability. Savannahs are known to jump up on top of doors, refrigerators and high cabinets. Some Savannahs can leap about 8 feet (2.5 m) high from a standing position. As, pets, they are commonly compared to dogs in their loyalty, and they will follow their owners around the house like a canine. They can also be trained to walk on a leash like a dog, and even fetch...
