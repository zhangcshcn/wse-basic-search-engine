Featured Portals in Wikipedia
A featured portal is a portal which is regarded by the community as being an example of Wikipedia's finest work. This page is where featured portal candidates are considered by the community against the featured portal criteria.
Nominators are expected to make an effort to address objections. A portal should not be a featured portal candidate and at the same time be listed at portal peer review. Users are asked not to add a second nomination here until the first has gained support and concerns have been substantially addressed. Do not split a nomination page into subsections, which will cause problems in its archiving (if necessary, use bolded headings). Please respond positively to constructive criticism.
For a nomination to be promoted to featured portal status, consensus must be reached that it meets the criteria. Consensus is built among the reviewers and nominators. If, after sufficient time, objections considered actionable have not been resolved or consensus for promotion has not been reached, a nomination will be removed from the list and archived. Consensus may be determined by any editor in good standing who is not materially involved in the portal's development or maintenance, or in any related WikiProjects. The process is overseen by the Featured Portal directors Cirt and OhanaUnited.
A bot will update the portal talk page after the portal is promoted or the nomination archived; the delay in bot processing can range from minutes to several days, and the {{FPOC}} template should remain on the talk page until the bot updates {{ArticleHistory}}. If a nomination is archived, the nominator should take adequate time to work on resolving issues before re-nominating—typically at least a few weeks.
At present, there are 173 featured portals, of a total of 1476 portals on Wikipedia.

Nomination procedure

Before nominating a portal for featured portal status on this page, compare it against the featured portal criteria and ensure that it meets all criteria before nominating.

It is strongly recommended that you use the portal peer review process before nominating the portal. Peer reviews help to identify and fix basic improvement needs before they might be used as the basis for opposing a nomination.
You may also wish to observe other featured portals in the same topic to get ideas on how to further improve your portal before nomination.


Place {{FPOC}} on the talk page of the nominated portal, and click the "initiate nomination" link – This will allow you to initiate the nomination in the correct format.

Note: If you are resubmitting the portal after a previously failed nomination, it is important that you follow the following instructions correctly:




Use the move tab to rename the previous nomination to a new title:

example: move Wikipedia:Featured portal candidates/Portal:Example to Wikipedia:Featured portal candidates/Portal:Example/Archive 1
Go back to the template you left on the talk page of the nominated portal, and replace the code {{FPOC}} with {{FPOC|Archive 1}}. Save the page and re-click the "initiate nomination" link to start the nomination again. These instructions do not work; They presume no redirect will be left behind - only a possibility for admins. Please update with correct instructions.






Fill in the blanks of the page, including why you are nominating the portal and other necessary details about the portal that need to be covered.
Click this link and place the following code {{Wikipedia:Featured portal candidates/Portal:Example}} (replacing Example with the name of your portal) directly under the header, and above all previous nominations. This will transclude the nomination subpage you created for your nominated portal to be seen on the main candidacy page. Be sure to include an edit summary that clearly states which portal you are nominating: e.g., nominating Portal:Example.
Nominator is strongly encouraged to watchlist the nomination page.
Nominator may wish to leave a neutrally worded notice at the talk pages of relevant WikiProjects.

Supporting and objecting
Please read nominated portals fully before deciding to support or oppose a nomination.

To edit nominations in order to comment on them, you must click the "edit" link to the right of the portal nomination on which you wish to comment (not the overall page's "edit this page" link).
If you approve of a portal, write '''Support''' followed by your reasons.
If you oppose a nomination, write '''Object''' followed by the reason for your objection. Each objection must provide a specific rationale that can be addressed. If nothing can be done in principle to "fix" the source of the objection, the objection may be ignored. This includes objections to a portal's suitability for the Wikipedia.

To withdraw an objection, strike it out (with <s>...</s>) rather than removing it.


Any registered editor may express an opinion. "Supports" and "opposes" from IP editors will be crossed out, but their comments on portal content should be considered.




To archive a nomination



Any editor in good standing is welcome to analyse consensus in a nomination, and close it accordingly. There are featured portal directors who are trusted and willing to close difficult or contentious nominations in which they haven't expressed an opinion. If you would like to ask that a nomination be closed, have concerns over a closure, or seek clarification in any regard, please ask at the talk page.


Remove the transcluded discussion from this page (click here). While removing it, mention the name of the portal in the edit summary.
Transclude the nomination to the promoted or not promoted log, as appropriate.
Update the Template:Featured portal log tallies by clicking here.
If the article was not promoted, remove the {{FPOC}} template and update the {{article history}} template.
If the article was listed at featured portals, it has been promoted and you can add the star to the portal, by adding {{featured portal}} to the bottom of the portal page. You will also need to upgrade Project assessments, close the FPOC, remove the {{FPOC}} template, and update ArticleHistory.
For successful nominations:

Add the portal to Portal:Featured portals, and remember to update the subtotal in the section heading.
Add <sup>[[File:Cscr-featured.svg|11px]]</sup> to the portal's listing on Portal:Contents/Portals.
Update Wikipedia:Goings-on by clicking here.
Update Template:Announcements/New featured content by clicking here.

Nominations[edit]
Portal:Linguistics[edit]
Worked to bring the portal back to an acceptable status and it seems to fit the featured portal standards. The topic is broad as it covers an entire academic field that has a large amount of quality content. I have queued content for the next three months and will continue to add more as time goes on.

Comments by Dharmadhyaksha


There are many pages related to this portal that are not categorized under Category:Linguistics portal; such as Portal:Linguistics/Featured phone/January 2016, Portal:Linguistics/Featured article/January 2016 and tons of others. Such uncategorized pages are difficult to track.




Category added. Wugapodes (talk) 16:43, 14 January 2016 (UTC)




How many featured article, featured phones and sets of DYKs are included in the portal? The numbers might help reviewers in gauging.




The features are manually selected and included rather than being chosen from a list. Features are currently queued for three months. The Linguistics WikiProject lists 42 articles at or above GA quality and 258 at B class. Wugapodes (talk) 16:43, 14 January 2016 (UTC)




Are all featured articles actually featured? Means how many of those are FAs, GAs or what classes are they?




I have changed the wording from "featured" to "selected" as not all articles selected are "featured articles". Selected articles are required to be at least B-class to ensure quality but also allow a larger pool of content for nominators to choose from. Preference is given to articles GA and above. The phones are selected without regard to quality of the article as it is the phone that is being selected rather than the article. Wugapodes (talk) 16:43, 14 January 2016 (UTC)

@Wugapodes: The "will continue to add more as time goes on" approach doesn't seem to work. There is just a redlink in the selected article box for May (as was for April). It would be better if there were some (at least 30) pages, which would appear randomly on the page. Armbrust The Homunculus 14:08, 9 May 2016 (UTC)




@Armbrust: You are correct. I've been working to convert more of them to random displays and forgot about the articles. They've been redone. There are currently 17 pages, I will work to add more. Wugapodes (talk) 19:22, 9 May 2016 (UTC)




Oppose the nomination has stalled, clearly, but in any event there is insufficient content: just 2 DYK rotations, and commented-out sections for featured biography and picture (also for news, but that's not an issue these days). That leaves the page looking very unbalanced between left and right. BencherliteTalk (using his alt account Bencherheavy) 12:11, 21 September 2016 (UTC)
Oppose per Bencherlite/heavy. — Yellow Dingo (talk) 10:25, 27 October 2016 (UTC)

Portal:Europe[edit]
This portal meets all the criteria for featured status. All information listed on its main page are featured and the best content related to Europe on Wikipedia. --HombreHistorico (talk) 16:09, 28 November 2016 (UTC)

Oppose far too little quality content to represent an entire continent. The portal represents "Europe" through a mere 10 biographies, for instance, one of which is Kierkegaard which was delisted from FA status over 6 years ago. So the claim that "all information listed on its main page are featured" is false. I found and removed 2 non-free images as well before giving up. Needs more work and more content.
