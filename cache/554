Featured pictures in Wikipedia
This page highlights the finest images on Wikipedia. The featured picture criteria explain that featured pictures must be freely licensed or in the public domain, must be of a high technical quality, and must add significantly to at least one article on Wikipedia. There are currently 6,051 featured pictures, and they are categorized by the topic they represent. All featured pictures are also available in a category.
If you wish to add a specific image to this page, please nominate it on Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates.
One featured picture is chosen as the picture of the day. You can include a box displaying the current picture of the day anywhere (e.g., your user page) by adding the text {{pic of the day}} or {{POTD}} where you want the picture to be shown.
Featured pictures from all Wikimedia projects can be browsed by subject or by country on Wikimedia Commons.
