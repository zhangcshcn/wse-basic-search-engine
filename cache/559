Former featured portals
This page lists portals that used to have featured status, but were demoted because they no longer met the featured portal criteria. Featured portals can only be demoted through a consensus derived from a featured portal review. Of course, the portals listed here do not have to stay here: be bold in updating and improving them, and help bring them back to featured status.
At present, there are 173 featured portals, of a total of 1476 portals on Wikipedia.
