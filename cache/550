Featured portals in Wikipedia

This page highlights portals that are regarded as being particularly useful, attractive, and well-maintained. Of the many portals on Wikipedia, these featured portals are those which stand out. To nominate a portal to become a featured portal, please first see the general standards and then add the portal to the list at featured portal candidates.
At present, there are 173 featured portals, of a total of 1476 portals on Wikipedia. Thus, about 1 in 9 portals is listed here. Portals that no longer meet the criteria can be proposed for improvement or removal at Wikipedia:Featured portal review.
A small bronze star () on the top right corner of a portal's page indicates that the portal is featured. Additionally, if the current portal is featured in another language version, a star will appear next to the language page link, in the list on the left of the page.
