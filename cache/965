Category:Wikipedia semi-protected project pages

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search




This is a maintenance category. It is used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project and is not part of the encyclopedia. It contains pages that are not articles, or it groups articles by status rather than content. Do not include this category in content categories.
This is a hidden category. It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference 'Show hidden categories' is set.



This category and its subcategories contain project pages which have been semi-protected in line with the Wikipedia:Protection policy. Semi-protection prevents a page from being edited by anonymous and newly registered users. For fully protected pages, which can be edited only by administrators, see Category:Wikipedia protected pages.
To add a page to this category, use {{pp-semi-protected}}. This should only be done if the page is in fact semi-protected.
Note that adding the template does not in itself protect the page. Conversely, protecting the page does not automatically add the template (or any other visible protected-page category linkages), which results in some pages having a "view source"-tab instead of "edit this page" and yet not showing "Semi-protected" at the bottom -- a situation new users may find rather confusing. Therefore, it is best to always add the template immediately after protecting the page.
