For the Volunteer Response Team, see WP:OTRS.
In most cases, you can use the {{unblock}} template on your talk page to request an unblock. If you have had talk page access removed or find the template to be complicated, you can use the link below to request an unblock via the Unblock Ticket Request System (UTRS). Please be sure to read the guide to appealing blocks before submitting a request. In some circumstances, you may be asked to request the creation of an account. Please see the username policy for guidance on acceptable usernames.

Instructions


Fill out all fields on the page linked below.




Note: Please understand that we are not able to recover or delete accounts. If you forget a password or email address, then we cannot recover it. The only way to fix this is to create an account and request a usurp.
Check your e-mail inbox for any possible updates or problems that may occur with your request. A request may be fulfilled in several minutes, or it may take longer, so please be patient. Be sure to check your "spam" folder if you have not received an e-mail within several hours, although the process may take longer on rare occasions.





 Submit a block appeal

Access requirements
UTRS access is limited to users who have undergone a community vetting process for higher tool access such as sysops, bureaucrats, and stewards in addition to Wikimedia Foundation Community Advocacy staff. Access is granted through an admin registration screen and may take 24–48 hours to complete.
Reviewing an appeal
Administrators reviewing an appeal should take the time to consider all elements of the appeal. The UTRS interface will gather some information about the block affecting the user but it may also require the reviewing administrator to check on Wikipedia for more information. Administrators may use the interface to assist in reviewing the appeal, but ultimately each review is an individual administrator responsibility. Generally each appeal should follow this process:

Direct appeals containing threats, slander, and abusive language to Tool Admins for UTRS ban
Determine whether this appeal contains all needed information. If the block is an autoblock, the reviewing administrator may need to send an email to the appellate to ask for their IP address.
If the block is a checkuser block, send it to review by checkusers
If the block is an open proxy block, send it to review by WP:OPP
If the block is an Arbcom block, direct the user to Arbcom list
If the block is for anonymous only IPs, direct the user to WP:ACC
Determine the block on its merits to accept or decline using Wikipedia:Blocking policy#Unblocking
If the unblock has been repeatedly declined and resubmitted, consider directing the ticket to Tool Admins for temporary UTRS ban

Further information

If you need any further information, please ask at the talk page.
