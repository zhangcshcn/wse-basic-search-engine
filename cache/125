Scope[edit]
Most articles within Category:Technology and its sub-categories are within our scope. There are several other projects with similar scopes, which we hope to work closely with.
Goals[edit]

To improve Wikipedia's coverage of technology by creating, expanding, and maintaining such articles.
To provide guidelines and recommendations for articles that describe all aspects of technology.
To serve as the central point of discussion for issues related to technology in Wikipedia.
To maintain the technology portal and its sub-portals
To create something new on Wikipedia.

Structure[edit]
WikiProject Technology has developed several structural features to help manage our work

Coordinators are responsible for maintaining the administrative aspects of the project
Departments host work on several specialized tasks, including article quality assessment, detailed article and content review, and offline publication.
Task forces are more informal groups for collaboration on specific topics within history.

Improve the bird's eye view[edit]
The entire subject and Wikipedia's coverage of it is intended to be summarized in the Outline of technology and its branch outlines. These are in turn part of Wikipedia's outline system which is one of Wikipedia's main contents systems.
Please look it over and fill-in missing topics. If Wikipedia has an article or article section about those topics, please add links to them.
While analyzing the outline, please answer the following questions (and fix the outline as needed):

What's missing?
Is the structure of the outline (sections and indents) representative of the subject?
Does the outline help understand the relationships between the topics presented in the best way possible?

The overall purpose of the outline is to help readers comprehend the subject by showing what belongs to it, and within the subject what belongs to what.
The outline is a taxonomy of the subject, and also serves as a table of contents and navigation aid to browse Wikipedia's articles (and article sections) about the subject.
It is also a useful tool for the WikiProject to analyze, plan, develop, and revise technology-related material. It is a hub from which to organize technological topics.
It was built as a "reverse outline", a structural model of an existing work, which in addition to being a summary of the work, can reveal the gaps and other weaknesses for revision purposes.
Please help improve it.
It's our bird's eye view.
Thank you.
Other[edit]

Answer requests for comments


Vital articles[edit]
These articles need to gain featured status as soon as possible:

Technology (Comparison: Mathematics)
List of basic technology topics (Comparison: List of basic geography topics)
List of technology topics (Comparison: List of biology topics)
Glossary of technology topics (Comparison: Glossary of philosophical isms)
Technology index/List of technology articles (Comparison: List of mathematics articles)

Opentasks[edit]
Feel free to add any articles needing improvement you come across here:

Technology - Needs cleanup
Tank - Needs reorganising, good though
Category:Wikipedia requested photographs of technology
Agitated Nutsche Filter - has multiple maintenance tags (I hope this is the correct place to find an expert to sort this article out, thanks).
HTTP handler - very short

Organization[edit]
Coordinators[edit]
The project coordinators are generally responsible for maintaining all of the procedural and administrative aspects of the project, and serve as the designated points-of-contact for procedural issues. They are not, however, endowed with any special executive powers.
Departments[edit]
Assessment[edit]
The Assessment department finds historical articles and rates them on the Quality scale.
Collaboration[edit]
The Collaboration department serves to improve articles that have been assessed by the assessment department by assigning large groups of editors to improve those articles. Help can be requested for an article you are working on or youhave found abandoned. A list of opentasks can also be found here
Review[edit]
The Review department carries out peer reviews on historical articles and nominates articles for good and featured status. It also carries out A-Class reviews on articles within our scope.
Task forces[edit]
News and Views: South Africa Technology Review
Africa Task forces[edit]
African Technology sector is importtant. It is reviewed by various regions; South Africa Technology Review, East Africa Medical Journal, North Africa Economist and West Africa Chemical Review.
